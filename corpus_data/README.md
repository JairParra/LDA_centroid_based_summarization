## DUC dataset
- This is the dataset employed in the *Centroid-based Text Summarization through Compositionality of Word Embeddings* paper. 

  *Dataset and Metrics During the document understanding conference (DUC)5 from 2001 to
  2007, several gold standard datasets have been   developed to evaluate the summarization methods.
  In particular, we evaluate our method on   multi-document summarization using the DUC2004 Task 2 dataset composed by 50 clusters, 
  each of which consists of 10 documents coming from Associated Press and New York Times newswires.
  For each cluster, four summaries written by different humans were supplied. For the evaluation,
  we adopt the ROUGE (Lin, 2004), a set of recallbased metrics that compare the automatic and human summaries 
  on the basis of the n-gram overlap. In our experiment, we adopt both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-26 .*
