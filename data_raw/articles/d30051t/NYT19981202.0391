American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian 
Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war 
crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav 
Krstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast 
Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the 
first serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack 
on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events 
of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched 
off, presumably to their deaths, as U.N. peacekeepers stood by. The 
indictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during 
and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. 
He is indicted both in connection with ``direct personal involvement 
in the commission of these crimes'' as well as his command responsibility. 
He is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity. Krstic 
was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, 
but was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica. 
He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, 
Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, 
both of whom are wanted by the tribunal. And he is considered capable, 
if he is willing to testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, who has not been indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor 
of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 
called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said she 
was delighted with the arrest. The general was only indicted on Oct. 
30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so 
there would be a better chance of a successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large 
``should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice.'' James 
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest ``serves 
as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes, who remain 
at large, that they will be held individually accountable for their 
actions.'' The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the 
hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his 
government would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping forces 
``to the necessary minimum.'' Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate 
candidate backed by Washington in September elections, said the arrest 
of Krstic had ``embittered and upset'' the Bosnian Serbs and would 
harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 
Bosnian war. He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks 
were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote. A senior official 
of a NATO country called the arrest ``very good news'' and said it 
was ``a warning to Milosevic himself'' and others who have not been 
publicly indicted that ``the murders committed have not been forgotten.'' 
A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the 
American sector, ``was a sign that this is a continuing process.'' 
NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted 
for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject 
of sealed indictments. There have been numerous calls for the arrest 
of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they 
normally are accompanied by armed guards. NATO forces have never tried 
to arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public 
reaction from Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic 
are believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, 
which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. Krstic, 
who was transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who 
has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there. 
He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested 
while traveling on the road to Bijelina. At the outset of the war 
in 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior 
Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. 
In 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official 
said in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility 
for ``anti-terrorist units'' who were given some of the most difficult 
tasks. ``Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't 
talk about it,'' the official said. ``But everyone believes it was 
the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing.'' In Banja 
Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested 
the arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier. 
Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, 
now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and 
promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given 
the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. He also said that the 
arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send 
an important message. Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict. 
It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, 
when the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks 
to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that 
Srebrenica would be a ``safe area'' and the United Nations would protect 
them. But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica 
with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched 
in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off. ``Srebrenica 
signaled the massive failure of the West,'' said Daalder. ``It galvanized 
the United States and NATO to act.'' At a London conference later 
in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas with 
massive air strikes if necessary. After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo 
marketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began, signaling the 
last chapter of the war and leading to the American-brokered Dayton 
Accords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member 
of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest. 
``We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come 
for Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice,'' said the aide, 
Mirza Jajric. The arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member 
countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
met in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to keep the 
peace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. Under a deal pressed 
on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 
civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political 
settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. Macedonia's government 
Wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its 
border with Kosovo. Those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid 
of the civilian monitors if necessary.
