He called himself the ``Serb Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling 
as his nickname. In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge 
panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious 
offense. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in 
October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many 
observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence. Although 
his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes 
against humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ 
Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide. By 
pressing on with a genocide trial, prosecutors will be able to call 
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the 
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors 
of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To 
convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the murders 
_ most of them carried out with close-range shots from an automatic 
pistol _ were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic 
group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who was arrested 
in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, has 
pleaded guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. The charges cover the murders as well as three beatings 
and the plundering of property. In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic 
told the tribunal he wanted to ``cleanse my soul.'' He will officially 
be convicted of those charges during the genocide trial. Jelisic's 
victims were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former 
port complex on the banks of the Sava River. Although most victims 
were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton 
and then fatally shot her. U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified 
himself to prisoners as the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, 
and bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed. Set up in 1993, 
the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and 
a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but 
it has yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide 
trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, 
died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.
