To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of 
genocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims 
before his morning coffee.'' Opening a genocide trial Monday at the 
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 
30-year-old mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride 
in the genocidal symbolism it represented.'' Jelisic pleaded guilty 
in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run 
Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. By trying 
him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call evidence about 
the background of Jelisic's murders, including the involvement of 
more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors of his killing 
spree chance to tell their story in court. Bowers told a three-judge 
tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted in interviews with investigators 
to far more killings than the dozen to which he has pleaded guilty. 
Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the end 
of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He faces a 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment. ``We will never be able to 
fix the exact number'' of victims, Bowers said. ``But if we are to 
believe even a small percentage of the totals which Goran Jelisic 
claimed, then his victims certainly number well over 100.'' As the 
trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological report which 
stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a 
``borderline personality disorder.'' Wearing a striped sweater and 
black jeans, Jelisic brought a laptop computer into court and took 
notes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his 
chair, his head still, looking impassively around the courtroom. Jelisic's 
campaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set up to deal 
exclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness. ``Once Goran 
Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was 
still in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people,'' Bowers 
told judges, citing statements made by witnesses due to testify later 
in the trial. ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the 
face of Goran Jelisic,'' he said. Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, 
who held no official rank, was released by Bosnian Serb authorities 
from jail, where he was serving three years for fraud, and sent to 
Brcko to murder Muslims. He told investigators that on his arrival 
in the town, which was of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he 
was given a list of Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as 
possible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task. ``Witness 
testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was not a reluctant 
tool of the genocide who was being compelled by Serb authorities to 
act against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor said. ``Quite to the contrary, 
the testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic was an efficient 
and enthusiastic participant in the genocide.'' Set up in 1993, the 
U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian 
Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has 
yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide trial was 
halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a 
ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.
