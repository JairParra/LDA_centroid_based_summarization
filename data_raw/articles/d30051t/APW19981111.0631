The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized 
Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe 
alleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security 
Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle 
Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials 
to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.'' ``The intentional 
and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply 
with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal 
is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,'' 
she said. The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following 
the refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor 
Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo. 
McDonald asked the Security Council to impose ``measures which are 
sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
into the fold of law-abiding nations.'' Hundreds of people, mostly 
ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven 
from their homes since February, when Serb forces began a crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The tribunal wants to look 
into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict.
