Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome 
Zejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this 
week after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of 
war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led 
Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three 
others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison 
terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards. Delalic held 
up his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted by his family and 
then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of 
Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him was planned. ``This is 
the book of 500 pages in which it says 12 times Delalic is not guilty,'' 
he told reporters. ``More important is that acts commited by some 
weren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army. These acts were qualified 
as acts of individuals that happened on a daily basis,'' he said. 
Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek compensation 
for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spent almost three 
years in confinement.
