Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating 
alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international 
legal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting was the 
first international debate in Yugoslavia over the U.N. tribunal's 
work and the government's cooperation with it. The tribunal, established 
by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands. 
Despite objections to the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed the 
two-day discussions _ organized by the Belgrade-based, non-governmental 
Humanitarian Law Center _ to take place without any problems. State-run 
media largely ignored the event. Though there were some disagreements, 
participants in the discussions generally agreed that crimes against 
humanity cannot go unpunished. ``The indicted who are not in The Hague 
are at-large because of the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities 
to arrest and extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative 
of the American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting 
of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in cases where 
Serbs were the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics 
that fought wars for their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned 
the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers 
wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. Last week, it also refused 
to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's 
southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting 
government forces. ``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' 
said Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign 
ministry. He said the U.N. court was influenced by powerful countries 
that dominate the international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, 
the U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crimes, demanded 
Yugoslavia's full cooperation.
