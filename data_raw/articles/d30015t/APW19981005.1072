With NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke delivered an 11th-hour warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president 
to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. 
But there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down. Following 
his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement 
denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' which favored separatist 
ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast by government 
television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province 
for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat 
to other countries in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate 
to the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday 
after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior 
NATO officials. There was no statement from Holbrooke after the meeting. 
Before boarding a plane for Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions 
in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance 
started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic 
to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists. Holbrooke 
said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of 
the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic 
and other Balkan leaders that ended the 3 and one-half year Bosnian 
war in 1995. In Washington, President Clinton expressed concern that 
Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false promises'' 
to avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, in a telephone call with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with 
U.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press 
secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. ``What happens next 
depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart quoted the president telling 
the Russian leader, who has opposed the use of force against Moscow's 
longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations, 
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO military 
action was imminent. ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later 
this week we will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters 
after a special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony 
Blair. In Brussels, NATO officials said they were ready to launch 
airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack. If that first 
airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior NATO official said 
on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash a ``fully fledged 
air campaign'' involving hundreds of planes. At the United Nations, 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their 
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution 
demanded a cease-fire. In a widely anticipated report to the Security 
Council, Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, 
decried the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear 
beyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces were responsible 
for the bulk of them. The U.N. chief also said rebel forces of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible for human rights violations, 
a charge the KLA quickly denied. NATO countries had been awaiting 
the U.N. chief's report to determine whether to use military force 
to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy 
like they had until 1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians 
in the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness 
to declare Serb noncompliance, State Department spokesman James Foley 
said the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met the 
conditions laid down by the Security Council. Briefing reporters in 
Washington, Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure 
to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leaders and 
the continued presence of ``major army units'' in southeastern Kosovo 
near Albania's border. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told 
an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced 
with the imminent danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant 
Serbia and smaller Montenegro. ``The threats are serious,'' Prime 
Minister Momir Bulatovic said. ``And I call on this parliament to 
conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. 
Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.'' One option was 
for parliament to declare a state of emergency _ a step toward a mobilization 
of all military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the 
measure ``when the first bomb drops on our territory.'' In an attempt 
to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted 
a Russian proposal for an investigation by the 54-nation Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly 
rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the 
organization is restored. The prime minister also said there was no 
longer any fighting in Kosovo, which has 2 million residents. He said 
five of the 10 special police units had been removed from Kosovo and 
the others had been returned to their barracks in the province. One 
diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there 
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of 
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that 
pulled out Sunday. Some army units remain in the field, and there 
is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, 
tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without 
shelter.
