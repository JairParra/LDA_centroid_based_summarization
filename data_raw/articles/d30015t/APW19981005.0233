The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President 
Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless 
he takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the 
southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put 
the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise 
by moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western 
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including 
tanks, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special 
envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in

with Milosevic. ``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have 
abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke 
said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and 
Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. ``The situation therefore 
remains fully as serious today as it was a week or two ago,'' he said. 
``We hope to make clear to President Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia 
the extreme gravity of the situation.'' On Sunday, Milosevic met with 
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, 
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. 
The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov 
and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures 
are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation,'' 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, 
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome 
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and 
take part in peace talks, he said. In Berlin, 7th graf pvs
