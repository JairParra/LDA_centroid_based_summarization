With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister 
warned Monday the nation faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and 
claimed the government is taking steps to comply with international 
demands for peace in Kosovo. But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
told reporters that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met 
the conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council. ``The reality 
coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' Solana 
said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I can tell you we 
are ready.'' In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic 
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days 
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. But Annan said he 
did not ``have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment 
of compliance as required by the Security Council'' and suggested 
the 15 members may want to make their ``own judgement in this respect.'' 
Following a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. special 
envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian 
province was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke said he would 
tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of ``the extreme gravity 
of the situation.'' Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade late Monday afternoon and was expected 
to meet Milosevic in the evening.
