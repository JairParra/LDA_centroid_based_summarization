BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said 
Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks 
ago. Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation'' 
when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. 
Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana 
and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said 
``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, 
the capacity for its resumption is there.'' ``The situation therefore 
remains fully as serious today as it was a week or two ago,'' he told 
reporters before flying to Belgrade. He plans to meet with the Kosovan 
Albanian leaders on Tuesday. ``We hope to make clear to president 
Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the 
situation,'' he said.
