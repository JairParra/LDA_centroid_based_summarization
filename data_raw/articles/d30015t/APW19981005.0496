The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable 
unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province. 
Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense 
on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks 
and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up 
to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been 
pulled out. However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that 
the Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and 
the removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops. Holbrooke spoke in 
Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic. ``We 
hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia 
the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting 
with NATO leaders. Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations 
continued unabated. ``At NATO, the planning for military action is 
serious, intense and sustained,'' he said. Serbian police and the 
Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the 
crackdown that began in late February. The conflict has killed hundreds 
_ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. 
Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic 
met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister 
Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's 
top defense officials. The Russians are against using NATO force in 
Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur 
``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement 
of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin 
told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia 
must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take 
urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees 
can return home and take part in peace talks, he said. In Berlin, 
German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could 
come ``within days.'' NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present Monday to the 
Security Council on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands. Serb 
authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim 
government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic 
in Yugoslavia. On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic 
said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. 
Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission until its membership 
in the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed 
there was no longer any fighting in the secessionist, majority Albanian 
province. He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed 
from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province. 
A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo dispute 
solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall defend 
our country with all means.'' One option could be for parliament to 
declare a state of emergency _ a step which could lead to a general 
mobilization of all military-aged men. The head of Yugoslavia's other 
republic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international 
demands and avert a NATO attack. ``We have to avert a clash with the 
whole world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's 
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.
