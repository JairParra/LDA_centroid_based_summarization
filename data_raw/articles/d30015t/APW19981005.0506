With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister 
warned Monday the nation faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and 
claimed the government was taking steps to comply with international 
demands for peace in Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan said ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians 
within recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. 
But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide an 
independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security Council'' 
and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own judgement 
in this respect.'' But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the 
situation in the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks 
ago. Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where 
he planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
``the extreme gravity of the situation.'' Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's 
prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that 
the country ``is faced with the imminent danger of war.'' Kosovo is 
a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. ``The threats 
are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. ``And I call on 
this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent 
danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.'' 
One option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency 
_ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged 
men. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government 
had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia had 
repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership 
in the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed 
there was no longer any fighting in the rebellious, majority Albanian 
province. He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed 
from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province. 
In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would 
not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack. ``While 
the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the capacity for 
its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO 
Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe 
Wesley K. Clark. ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious 
today as it was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear 
to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity 
of the situation.'' Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, 
Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands 
and avert a NATO attack. ``We have to avert a clash with the whole 
world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's 
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. Djukanovic, 
a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav president to address 
the nation ``with an unambiguous message'' that he has accepted all 
U.N. resolutions and agreements he made with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's ``undemocratic 
regime.'' Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air 
defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy equipment 
out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored 
vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been 
counting on Russia to block any U.N.-sanctioned military moves by 
the Western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President 
Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. Although 
the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev 
said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately 
taken for a radical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid 
such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army 
and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian 
crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace 
talks, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German 
radio that NATO action could come ``within days.'' Serb authorities 
appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government 
in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo 
Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February. The 
conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and 
left more than 275,000 refugees. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent 
of the province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence 
or substantial self-rule. Momentum for outside involvement has increased 
in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian 
civilians in the forests of Kosovo. Although the United States and 
Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence 
for Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries 
with Albanian populations. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA 
offered to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi 
said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper 
Bujku that ``we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and 
``we shall provide assistance... if it is asked of us.'' Krasniqi 
accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given up on independence'' 
and having become ``the servants of the enemy,'' by agreeing to accept 
autonomy but not independence. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have 
rejected the new interim government, which was drawn up without their 
participation. The council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic 
Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims.
