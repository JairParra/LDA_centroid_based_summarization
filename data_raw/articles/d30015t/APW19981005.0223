The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President 
Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless 
he takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the 
southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put 
the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise 
by moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western 
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including 
tanks, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special 
envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in 
Kosovo is as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade 
for a meeting with Milosevic. ``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) 
may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' 
Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier 
Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. ``The 
situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it was a week 
or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic 
and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation.'' 
On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic 
and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. The Russians are against using 
NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes 
could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a 
radical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an 
attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security 
forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, 
ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, 
he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio 
that NATO action could come ``within days.'' NATO's decision may depend 
on a report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present 
to the Security Council Monday on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. 
demands. Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing 
an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant 
republic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have 
routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began 
in late February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them 
Albanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. A Yugoslav 
statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo dispute solved 
peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall defend our country 
with all means.'' The government said Friday that the fighting had 
ended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who 
are fighting for independence for the Serbian province. Although the 
United States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also 
oppose independence for the majority Albanian province, fearing that 
could destabilize other Balkan countries with Albanian populations. 
In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO forces 
if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published 
Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we wish they 
(airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall provide assistance... 
if it is asked of us.'' Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians 
of having ``given up on independence'' and having become ``the servants 
of the enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence. 
Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' 
25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. 
Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after stepping on a mine, the Serb 
Media Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the 
ethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting between government forces 
and the guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. 
Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim government, 
which was drawn up without their participation. The council is composed 
of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. 
Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week amid 
revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the forests 
of Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing 
troops and armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a post-airstrike 
peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to confirm or deny 
the report but repeated that Britain was ready to participate in a 
NATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night 
with his British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss the situation 
in Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine and Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright had a lengthy telephone conversation as well, 
the spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's 
government and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since 
the conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater 
scale. The report by the New York-based human rights organization 
says Milosevic has ``the primary responsibility for gross government 
abuses.''
