Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian 
separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia 
has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may 
well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats 
say. Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the 
scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace 
in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations 
prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention. 
Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched 
its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission 
to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade. As he has so often, 
Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of 
time and yet still accomplished what he wanted. This weekend, foreign 
diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a ``military stand-down'' 
had taken place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have waged 
a fierce offensive against Albanian rebels. The observers said that 
except for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav 
army were ``home.'' The daily reports of the observer mission, made 
up of U.S., European Union and Russian military experts, are one of 
the key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide 
whether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire. By putting 
the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo 
and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic 
may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said. 
But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the 
other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo 
Liberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo 
and its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian 
population that supports it. His military operation created more than 
250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to 
take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations. 
U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy 
who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia, 
to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo. 
The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's 
principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province, 
and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression 
since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who 
now seek independence. The West, fearing the precedent that independence 
for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying 
to mediate a middle course. In essence, diplomats said they believed 
that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year 
interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy 
arrangement. Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics 
of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able 
to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population 
into submission with impunity. ``The United States and its allies 
have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army,'' said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, 
a policy analysis organization, ``and taken three weeks to discuss 
military action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed.'' 
Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to 
live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic 
took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery 
and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose 
bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of 
large swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads. While he was 
doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington: 
he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania 
and Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area. 
All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo 
conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania 
and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause. 
Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just 
three years after peace was secured in Bosnia. Milosevic catered to 
Washington's concern that the conflict be contained. The Yugoslav 
army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that 
few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for 
the rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was 
unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political 
leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose 
main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany. 
For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim 
Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter 
that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity. For that 
procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban 
on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month 
before. After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military 
operations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and 
carry out the investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met with two 
self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western 
town of Junik but then broke off all contact. Clinton administration 
officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention 
would bolster the separatist forces. To try to put the best face on 
the situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept 
the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and 
report on military action. The monitors were slow in getting organized. 
By August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police, 
were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages 
in the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to 
the fighting. They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going 
on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise. In recent 
days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved, 
the monitors say. But there are some areas in central Kosovo around 
Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits 
because of land mines on the roads. The mines are believed to have 
been planted by the guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre 
of 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept. 
26. A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on 
Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police 
or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon. 
The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the 
vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a report 
by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday. 
The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking 
civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. But the violations 
by the guerrillas were on a ``lesser scale'' than the government abuses, 
the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused 
on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police 
forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early 
March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. At least 83 people, 
including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which 
involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. In 
the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through 
rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains 
politically secure. That is in part, his domestic critics say, because 
diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako 
Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature.
