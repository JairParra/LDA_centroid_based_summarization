The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic 
of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told 
him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in 
Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic was also told, the 
diplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the 
fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home. Most of 
these refugees are reluctant to return because many of the Serb police 
officers who destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods. 
After delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over the 
Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said at a news conference that NATO's military 
plans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a ``serious, intense 
and sustained basis.'' Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic was described 
by the American diplomats as ``not a do or die trip,'' but they added, 
``We're at a very serious juncture.'' Shortly after Holbrooke's meeting 
with Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on 
Serbian television in which he said the ``threats of aggression'' 
outlined by Holbrooke represented ``a criminal act.'' Milosevic, who 
rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose 
tough words cast an unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's 
position constituted ``support for Albanian terrorists and not the 
Albanian people.'' Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of 
supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo 
an independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added that ``for more than 
seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action.'' An 
American diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke planned to stress 
to Milosevic said there had been no expectation that the American 
envoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement. Rather, the point 
was to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and make explicit what was 
expected of him. ``It was not quite an ultimatum,'' the diplomat said, 
``but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance.'' 
The essence of Holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined in 
a United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago. The 
resolution ordered Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police 
forces that were sent to Kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to 
send back to their bases the military forces normally stationed in 
the province. So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic has withdrawn 
troops from the field but not all of them are in their barracks. Such 
a move is essential, American diplomats said, to create a conducive 
atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the 
province. The U.N. resolution also calls for a political solution. 
Holbrooke and the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, 
discussed with Milosevic a political document drawn up by the State 
Department that calls for broad autonomy for Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew 
the autonomy in 1989 as he began his campaign of Serb nationalism. 
The countryside in central Kosovo has been eerily silent since last 
Thursday. The sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been 
noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified burning 
villages have vanished from the green hills and valleys. Police checkpoints 
are more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week 
by the Yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors 
from the United States, European Union and Russia. These monitors, 
many of whom are former military officers, have reported that the 
Yugoslav army has ``stood down'' and that they have seen virtually 
no military action since late last week. There has been sporadic shooting, 
the monitors have reported. But this superficial calm is not good 
enough because the Serb military has the capacity to resume fighting 
very quickly, a NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added 
that a cease-fire in Kosovo is ``pretty much enacted.'' He also said 
that the ``trend toward compliance is positive.'' The interior ministry 
police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees 
who have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer 
said. Some interior ministry police officers had left the province, 
but not enough, he added. On the question of how badly damaged the 
KLA had been by the Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO 
officer said, ``It's a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled 
but not destroyed.'' Holbrooke's first stop Monday was Brussels, where 
he met with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday 
he plans to travel to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where he is 
scheduled to meet with the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to 
present the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo. He 
is expected back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another session 
with Milosevic.
