The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's 
trade minister said Thursday. Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then 
began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. ``Frankly 
speaking there is no reason to say that just because one man was arrested 
for something ... that it should bring any unrest,'' trade minister 
Rafidah Aziz said. ``Leaders come and go. ... They even get sacked 
in all countries of the world. They even die,'' she told a news conference 
in Manila, where she attended a meeting of Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations economic ministers. Rafidah said there have only been 
a few demonstrations in Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them 
``orchestrated.'' In recent visits to Chicago, New York, Houston and 
Boston, she said potential investors asked her about Anwar's arrest 
but were still interested in investing in Malaysia. Anwar said police 
beat him in custody. In recent appearances in court, where he is facing 
charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, he was seen with 
a black eye and a neck brace. At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine 
President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have 
spoken out against Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said he 
was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia 
in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a 
personal friend. He later said he would attend the summit and had 
only made the earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar. The Philippines, 
Malaysia and Indonesia are founding member countries of ASEAN, which 
also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
