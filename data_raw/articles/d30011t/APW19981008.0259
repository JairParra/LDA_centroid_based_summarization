Lawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent 
opponent, went to court Thursday to demand their client's release 
from indefinite detention. Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician 
Anwar Ibrahim, told reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas 
corpus appeal that says the dissident politician is being unjustly 
held. She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband, 
and asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?'' Anwar, 
51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows 
indefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around 
Malaysia at which he called for government reform and Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his 
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had 
differed with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession. 
But the prime minister said the deputy was fired because he was morally 
unfit. Anwar said Mahathir viewed him as a threat. Anwar since has 
been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is to 
go on trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded innocent to all the charges, which 
he says were trumped up by his political enemies. ``We claim that 
his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in court,'' said one 
of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He said the lawyers had asked 
the High Court for an early hearing on the request for Anwar's release. 
When Anwar appeared in court Monday, the judge had assured defense 
attorneys that they would have access to their client so that they 
could prepare their arguments for the trial. Azizah said authorities 
have spurned all her requests for family members to visit her husband 
on grounds that Anwar's case was still under police investigation. 
``I pleaded with the police to allow the children to see their father,'' 
she told reporters at the courthouse. ``I told them that I don't have 
to see my husband. But please let my son go and see him. But the police 
said no.'' Although Anwar remains in custody at the Bukit Aman federal 
police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrested 
under the ISA for participating in activities and rallies organized 
by Anwar have been released. Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International 
Islamic University, was released Wednesday after 16 days in jail. 
``I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during my involvement 
with the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,'' Sidek was quoted as saying 
by The Star daily. Despite the recent protests against him, Prime 
Minister Mahathir said Wednesday that support for his ruling party 
remains strong and there have been no defections from the party, which 
claims a membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million. He ruled 
out an early election to prove his popularity. A general election 
is not scheduled until 2000. Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. 
``There is no exodus from the party.'' This week, Mahathir declined 
to name a replacement for Anwar, who had been Malaysia's deputy prime 
minister since 1993. The absence of a successor could lead to a power 
struggle in the event Mahathir is forced to resign or dies, because 
there is no clear line of succession. Mahathir, 72, underwent heart 
bypass surgery in 1989.
