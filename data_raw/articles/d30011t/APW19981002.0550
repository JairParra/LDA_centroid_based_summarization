Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about 
who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious 
and only preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national 
news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday prayers 
at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state. 
``It is sufficient that the person does things acceptable by the people,'' 
Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent 
during his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir 
for leadership of the ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fired 
the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit for office. 
Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before 
being detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal 
homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations. 
Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward toppling 
him as prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant 
party, the United Malays National Organization. ``He appeared very 
good to me but he was actually planning ways of bringing me down. 
At first, I did not believe when people told me about this, but I 
now know this to be true,'' said Mahathir. Mahathir said Anwar had 
arranged for his supporters to contest for and gain control of the 
UMNO divisions so that he could win the party's top post in next year's 
party elections.
