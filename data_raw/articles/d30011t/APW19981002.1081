BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday expressed its 
``deep concern'' over reports of physical abuse of Malaysia's former 
deputy-prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last month. 
``The EU urges the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents 
will not occur again in the future and that Anwar Ibrahim be assured 
correct treatment while in custody,'' a statement by the 15 EU countries 
said. The EU ``hopes that appropriate action will be taken against 
any individuals, including officials, found responsible for such mistreatment,'' 
the statement added. On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office. Mahathir 
and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir 
feared him as an alternative leader. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign 
against the prime minister before being detained as a national security 
risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection 
with those allegations. Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court 
with a black eye and bruises on his neck and arms. He told the magistrate's 
courts he was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest. 
Faced with mounting public criticism, Mahathir called Thursday for 
a probe by the attorney general of the alleged mistreatment of Anwar. 
The EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation. It also 
welcomed the release of seven youth leaders, including Ahmad Zahid 
Hamidi, the head of the youth wing of the ruling United Malays National 
Organization and a former ally of Anwar, who were arrested last week 
in connection with demonstrations in favor of the ousted deputy-premier. 
``The EU expresses hope that the other political demonstrators still 
detained under the Internal Security Act will also be released soon,'' 
the statement said. The former deputy-premier, who was also finance 
minister, pleaded innocent this week to charges of sodomy and corruption. 
A number of Anwar's associates are still detained.
