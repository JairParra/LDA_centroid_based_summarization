Deprived of a voice in state-controlled newspapers and television, 
supporters of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the 
Internet to air their views. Although the government said police would 
``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, 
Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is 
``impossible to control.'' Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual 
misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia. In the realm of cyberspace, 
though, he's top dog. Within hours of Anwar's recent speech accusing 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozens of 
boot-legged recordings had been posted onto new websites hatched by 
supporters. Among the hottest images now making the Internet rounds 
are several news-photo versions of Anwar's badly bruised eye, which 
he claims was inflicted by police during his first night of detention. 
Most pro-Anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters to 
Mahathir, clippings of foreign news reports and prose scorching the 
72-year old prime minister. Most of the Internet content about Anwar 
is false or unverifiable, but the medium is tough to rein in, said 
Azzman Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company that set up Malaysia's 
Internet infrastructure. ``No website has been blocked or censored 
by the government,'' he said. Shortly after Anwar's arrest, one of 
the former leader's aides bragged that they had set up dozens of sites 
offshore, beyond the reach of the Malaysian government. Malaysian 
journalist M.G.G. Pillai, who runs a popular website on local politics, 
isn't surprised by the aggressive march toward cyberspace. ``When 
you're in the opposition and you have no access to resources and media, 
then you end up making use of what's available to air your grouses,'' 
he said, noting that membership on his site has soared by 40 percent 
since Anwar's ouster. The cyber explosion is a boon to most middle-class 
Malaysians, who are leery of local media. ``I've finally given up 
reading local newspapers. They're so skewed,'' said Michael Chan, 
a lawyer who upgraded his computer with a high-speed modem the day 
after Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. Chan uses the modem to download 
pictures of balaclava-clad police in bulletproof jackets busting down 
Anwar's front door before bundling him off to jail. Occasionally, 
he receives e-mail calling for organized rallies at the National Mosque 
and nearby Independence Square, where hundreds of protesters have 
been arrested by police. The advertised demonstrations don't always 
materialize. Other e-mails call for ``silent protests.'' Malaysians 
are being urged on the Internet now to switch off all lights for 10 
minutes on Oct. 6 to declare their ``state of sorrow, sadness and 
darkness'' over national injustice.
