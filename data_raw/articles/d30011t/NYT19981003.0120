Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable 
as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation 
that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs. It 
almost came true. In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who 
is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led 
to some of the world's fastest rates of growth. He drove Malaysians 
to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major 
investments around the world. He created a national affirmative-action 
program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians 
to share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian 
identity and pride. This year was to have been Mahathir's year of 
triumph, perhaps paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration 
of huge public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign 
leaders and sportsmen. But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia 
is on Asia's critical list, its economy teetering on the edge of disaster 
and its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable 
political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his 
deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption 
and illegal sex acts. The move set off street demonstrations and aroused 
international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends 
in foreign governments. One of the region's most stable and prosperous 
nations is suddenly in an uproar. It appears that as in Indonesia, 
Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressures of economic collapse 
have spawned a political crisis. In all those nations, the result 
was a change in leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? 
The answer is far from clear. Unlike in Indonesia, there has been 
little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. The ouster 
of former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted by many 
people. Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here. Malaysia 
is not familiar with political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, 
Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed 
when they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the streets 
in recent weeks. ``What we're seeing is unprecedented,'' said Ambassador 
John Malott of the United States. ``This has never happened in Malaysia, 
and nobody knows where it's going to go. You can write a lot of scenarios 
but we are in totally uncharted waters.'' Mahathir, the confident 
nation-builder, seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble. 
An economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for 
the last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent. 
Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off from international financial 
markets one month ago, turning his back on the foreign investors whom 
he once embraced and who had fueled the country's rapid growth. The 
move had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian currency, 
insulating it from the speculators Mahathir blames for the crisis, 
and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy. It 
is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of 
the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. But few 
foreign economists expect it to work for long. ``Mahathir is attacking 
the fundamental beliefs of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall 
Street,'' a foreign diplomat said. ``We are either watching economic 
theory being rewritten or reconfirmed _ and I don't think it's being 
rewritten.'' The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set 
off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar, 
the man he had been grooming to be his successor. Two weeks later, 
Anwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days, 
during which he says he was beaten by his jailers. Last week he was 
charged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could 
result in a prison term of up to 34 years. The harshness of those 
moves unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized 
Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals 
and politically assertive Muslims. For the first time in decades, 
Malaysians by the thousands demonstrated in the streets and in mosques 
and were met with tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten 
and hundreds were detained, although most were later released. With 
the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear 
expressed by one Western diplomat is of a ``downward spiral'' in which 
``suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds 
more discontent.'' People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now 
be numbered. But few venture a guess at what the number might be. 
Given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or 
leadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm as 
Anwar's trial proceeds. But he has struck a harsh blow to the morale 
of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard 
to build under the slogan ``Malaysia Can!'' In this generally decorous 
nation, the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each 
other father and son is disturbing to hear. Anwar, says the prime 
minister, is ``despicable'' and ``a sodomist.'' Mahathir, says his 
former deputy, is ``senile'' and ``insane.'' Malaysians, who have 
stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule with a mixture of 
gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned.
