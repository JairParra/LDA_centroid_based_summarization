The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president 
after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. 
``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation 
Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper 
As-Safir. Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting 
in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President 
Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor. 
Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday 
that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament 
at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15. The election is a formality 
since other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown 
its weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality before the election, 
the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public 
servants from running for president. The new president must be sworn 
in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office at the end of his six-year 
term. The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old 
tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister 
a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Agreement 
among the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the 
government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker 
Nabih Berri, little change was expected in government policy. Lahoud's 
nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head 
of state. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and 
the United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home 
and has good relations with Syria. But the choice could not have been 
sealed before a final say from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this 
country. His word is referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.'' 
Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander 
in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 
civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese 
army and in ending the reign of militias. In Lebanon, the army commander 
heads the air force, navy and the ground forces. Many hope he will 
copy his success with the military in government, which is plagued 
by nepotism and waste of public funds. But some fear that a military 
man in the nation's highest office could mean a return to the use 
of intelligence services to track civilian life _ the case under Fouad 
Chehab, the only other army commander to become president, who ruled 
from 1958 to 1964. ``The election of a military man is a threat to 
democracy in Lebanon,'' Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living 
in self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper.
