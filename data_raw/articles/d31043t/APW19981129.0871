Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from 
Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political 
crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. 
Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker 
capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, 
said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new 
Cabinet. There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing 
Hariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining 
tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the 
apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's 
economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 
53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction 
program, has been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who 
made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring 
economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. Lahoud, 
62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread 
popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up 
the graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made 
his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. 
Previous disputes among government leaders have cost the Central Bank 
hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the Lebanese 
pound. Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved 
only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this 
country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been 
expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to 
form the next government. The decree was to be issued after the president 
polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime 
minister. But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming 
support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president 
to select a prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential 
decree followed. The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because 
he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in 
selecting the premier. The Hariri camp argues that the president can 
poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot 
accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. The dispute, in fact, 
appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will 
be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former 
President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had 
a free hand in running the country.
