A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized 
the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said 
he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive 
post. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he 
and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member 
Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Although 
a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil 
the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express 
discontent at the choice and the process of his election. Lahoud is 
virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament 
speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing 
of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. ``Historically, we do 
not approve that a military man takes control of the country,'' Jumblatt 
told reporters after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi. 
Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common 
among anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt 
to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President 
Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some 
in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence 
agents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and 
1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander 
to become head of state. In nominating Lahoud, ``rules were not respected,'' 
Jumblatt said. ``Things were supposed to run in a more democratic 
way,'' said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces 
during the 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be sworn in on 
Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term. Jumblatt 
said ``there is adequate political diversity and competition in the 
country,'' implying that choosing a military man for president was 
unnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fears 
about military intrusion. He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep 
the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.'' 
Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political 
support at home and has good relations with Syria. He gained public 
admiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending 
the reign of militias. Many hope he will cleanse the government of 
nepotism and wastage of public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies 
with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime 
minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The 
government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials. Jumblatt 
said his party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend 
the Constitution so that senior public servants can run for president. 
Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic 
bishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed the choice 
of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said.
