Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment 
to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile 
Lahoud, as president. Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the 
main power broker in the country, making the election by Lebanon's 
pro-Syrian Parliament later this week just a formality. A total of 
113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including 
the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant. Eleven 
deputies were absent. Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, 
a Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest 
the choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and 
political support. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet 
Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs 
the constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution 
revokes a ban on senior civil servants from running for the presidency. 
The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office. 
Hrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year extension 
in 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep 
alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, 
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite 
Muslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion 
in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited 
with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the 
reign of militias. Many hope he will copy his success with the military 
in the government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public 
funds. But some fear of military dominance of public life.
