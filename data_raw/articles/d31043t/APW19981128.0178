Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office 
have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment 
from new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri is still the front-runner 
to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted 
sources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the 
128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a 
meeting with Lahoud Friday. According to the constitution, a president 
must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet 
through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members. 
A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through 
after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri had even scheduled 
Friday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate 
and former prime ministers, but that was canceled. The state-run National 
News Agency said that while only 62 deputies told Lahoud they supported 
Hariri, the rest refused to divulge their choice or left it to the 
president to decide. A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the 
backing of at least 100 deputies. The delay reflects the tug-of-war 
among the power brokers in the country. Under a formula aimed at preventing 
the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared 
equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister 
and a Shiite Parliament speaker. While the Christian Lahoud may have 
no objection to appointing the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament 
Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature are 
holding out to emphasize their value. The leading An-Nahar and other 
newspapers said the delay could last for days. But in the end, it 
is Hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his 
record in office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly 
created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed 
by the civil war. He is also credited with stabilizing the currency 
and restoring confidence in the postwar economy. But his government 
under former president Elias Hrawi were dogged by accusations of corruption. 
Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three 
times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. He 
has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded 
Hrawi on Tuesday. Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuilt 
the military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, 
has pledged in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued 
administration.
