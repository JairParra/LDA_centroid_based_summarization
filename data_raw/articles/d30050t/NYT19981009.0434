Nearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted Friday to condemn 
the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. The measure, a nonbinding 
resolution, was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. 
He is of Lithuanian descent, has a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown 
of Collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the 
Baltic states' past efforts against Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure 
is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as 
they stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement 
on spending bills with the White House, thus avoiding a government 
shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November 
elections. With time on their hands, many Republicans are using the 
House floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that 
they can boast about to the folks back home. Most of these matters 
have little chance of finding their way into law, but members hope 
to turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There are plenty 
of other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These 
tend to be special-interest matters that members hope will escape 
scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The sponsors of these measures 
now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry, which has 
been preoccupying Congress, the news media and the public and giving 
them cover to move their pet causes quietly into the gigantic omnibus 
package that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing. 
These quieter measures include one proposed by Mississippi's two senators, 
Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want agriculture 
export credits to buy chickens for Russia, which has bought the chickens 
but cannot pay for them. The chickens are from Mississippi. Democrats 
have little influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. But some 
Democrats are close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican 
goals, that their measures are taken seriously. These include Rep. 
John Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking Democrat on the national security 
subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who is pushing a measure 
to increase military pensions. Perhaps the best example of an attempt 
to force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require 
minors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives 
from federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed 
the measure to be brought to the floor as a way to appease the more 
conservative members, who believe they have been shortchanged by the 
budget process. It passed the House by a vote of 224-200 but has almost 
no chance of becoming law. The Senate does not plan to take it up, 
and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., 
said that votes like these were important because they put their sponsors' 
ideological foes on the record as opposing something that sounds reasonable, 
and that opposition can be used against them in the Nov. 3 election.
