In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said 
Friday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes, 
although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements 
of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. Clinton has 
stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has 
taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before 
moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' 
needs. He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, 
he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's 
economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support 
in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. After thanking the 
gathered donors for the ``very kind personal things'' they had said 
to him, the president declared, ``If I had to do it all over again, 
every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is 
today as compared to six years ago.'' As the applause died away, Clinton 
continued, ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live 
with the consequences of our mistakes in life.'' He added with a chuckle: 
``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. 
But nobody gets out of life for free.'' To the music of a saxophone 
and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch 
in a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate 
in Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a 
million dollars for the Democratic Party. By midsummer, the president's 
aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising 
remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. 
But as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached, 
his free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, 
he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost 
20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since 
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded, 
applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors. ``Mr. President, 
these are your friends here today,'' said Tony George, the host of 
the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played 
a similar role. But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were 
scattered along the president's motorcade route were reminders of 
calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some 
are heaping upon his presidency. At a rally for the president outside 
city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more 
years.'' Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds 
of people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. 
After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with 
shouts of ``We love you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning 
of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even 
mind the protesters, that's the American way.'' But, he added, he 
preferred it when they were in the minority, ``and that seemed to 
be the case.'' As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard 
for a local radio station, WNCX. ``Lovin', touchin', squeezin','' 
it read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with 
his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside 
them. The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly 
to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. Instead, 
in his remarks, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency 
about addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of 
struggling farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically does now before 
such partisan audiences, he also walked through his political calculation 
for the mid-term elections. Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans 
had bragged privately to him about their prospects. ``They tell me, 
`Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms 
because we have so much more money than you do,''' and because Democrats 
who turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in 
an off-year. That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton 
from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote. But he often goes 
further than that, saying that his predicament could actually help 
the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not 
bother to vote in a typical election. ``The people that were good 
enough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of 
hassles in their life,'' he said. But, he said, ``adversity is our 
friend,'' because it can overcome apathy and ``focus us on what is 
at issue here.'' What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements 
and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. 
``What have they done?'' he asked in Cleveland. ``They killed the 
minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed campaign 
finance reform. They killed the tobacco reform legislation.''
