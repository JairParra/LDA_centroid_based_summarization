It was not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist 
in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered 
Democrat. ``Speaker Newt Gingrich's office,'' it said, was calling 
to discuss a ``national leadership award.'' Dr. Rymer has won acclaim 
as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition 
seemed particularly grand. When she returned the call, she said she 
was told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee 
to advise Gingrich on legislation. Too good to be true? Well, Dr. 
Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually 
meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would 
be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. 
And oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to ``help 
our efforts,'' according to a transcript of a similar chat with another 
doctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives. 
With the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns out 
that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports 
candidates for the House, has been sponsoring similar calls to tens 
of thousands of small-business owners, including doctors. With this 
and other fund-raising programs, the committee says it has amassed 
$62 million for the elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say 
the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising, 
one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the 
Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar 
windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines. By citing the 
speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls 
are a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who 
might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. So was Dr. 
Stanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who votes 
as an independent and was also called. ``I was absolutely outraged,'' 
he said. ``Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category 
of consumer fraud.'' Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes 
in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, 
said, ``I have never heard of that particular device.'' But it doesn't 
appear illegal, he said, adding, ``It's a fund-raising gimmick to 
get attention.'' Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, 
nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, ``This is a 
new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware.'' 
When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. ``But 
this isn't going to be investigated because it's members of Congress 
who are doing it.'' Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any complaints 
and that there was no intent to deceive. ``The national leadership 
award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment,'' Harris 
said. ``It's part of bringing them into the process. It's important 
that they be recognized for the support they give the party.'' ``There's 
no quid pro quo'' that people solicited could receive awards for past 
contributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki is 
the message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking 
Gingrich's ``office'' and proposing the award. They say they envisioned 
a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol 
Dome. The calls, however, are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by 
any of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people 
with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp., 
a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron, 
Ohio. On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate 
1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. ``Every word in the script 
is approved by our clients,'' the company says on its Web site. ``Every 
conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal.'' Besides 
telemarketing for businesses, said Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the 
center, ``we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative 
political groups.'' However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers 
are instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional 
Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you?'' A doctor in Kansas 
City, Mo., who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named, 
dialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answering machines 
and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion, which is legal in Missouri. 
``We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker,'' says a 
woman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy. ``He 
is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much 
as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains 
to a single rate of 15 percent.'' To assure passage of the legislation, 
the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, 
``To help us do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals 
such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on 
his advisory council.'' Nancy continues: ``There will be correspondence 
with the speaker, such as conference calls. It's a great way that 
he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern 
you. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires.'' Later, Nancy says: ``As 
a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker 
our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor. And 
to be honest, he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could 
help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution 
of $500 or $1,000. ``Now that would be used on the nationwide media 
campaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really 
need. And as someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could 
I tell the speaker he could count on your help?'' The doctor demurs. 
``I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas,'' she tells Nancy. 
``Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my 
own representative.'' Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy 
is located. ``Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking 
to?'' the doctor asks. ``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy. ``This 
is the speaker's office.'' ``That I'm talking to,'' says the doctor, 
double-checking. ``Uh-huh,'' Nancy replies. The law prohibits political 
fund-raising calls from federal offices. Vice President Al Gore is 
under a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising calls he 
allegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. 
But the calls can be made from just about anywhere else, including 
campaign offices. Harris said the calls are ``in no way related to 
the speaker's OFFICIAL office.'' He added: ``What is more important 
is not where the calls get routed. People are more interested in an 
award with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call gets 
routed to Washington or Ohio.'' Turecki disagrees. ``I see it as basic 
sleaze,'' he said.
