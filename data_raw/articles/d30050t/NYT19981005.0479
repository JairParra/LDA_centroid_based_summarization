It was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one 
of New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the 
praises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president of the largest 
union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, 
the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health 
coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. It looked 
as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato _ or 
at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. Senate race in 
New York. But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the 
National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles 
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement 
is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful 
senator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions 
turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected. Although it 
may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union 
backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely as a result of the Lewinsky 
scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will 
gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the 
Republicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45. For labor leaders 
like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare. 
That fear has helped push other New York unions into Schumer's column, 
even though D'Amato had long courted them. Those unions include the 
teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, 
an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor 
leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, 
the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently 
defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and 
cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. ``We are worried 
about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive 
into the next century,'' Rivera said. Alarmed that the Democrats will 
lose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South 
Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. 
The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was 
based on national considerations. ``Unfortunately, the leadership 
of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt 
Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture 
as the Republicans of the Northeast,'' he said. ``They're far more 
conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more 
pro-business. We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance 
in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats.'' Trying to avoid 
a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as ``an effective senator.'' 
The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and the 
teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New 
York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the 
local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 
political calls a day. A spokesman for D'Amato said, ``Al D'Amato's 
proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals, 
representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue 
his efforts on behalf of working middle class families.'' His labor 
endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association 
and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides 
the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's 
parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 
350,000 members in New York State. Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato 
the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the 
founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees 
union. The convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aims to 
make the service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing 
together a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative 
strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees, 
and as part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service employees 
in New York State.
