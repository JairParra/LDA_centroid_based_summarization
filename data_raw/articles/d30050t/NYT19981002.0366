In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would 
have had little in common other than that they were Democrats with 
relatively safe seats. Price is a centrist who has represented this 
high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 
years, a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. 
Carson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up 
in politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty. But 
party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing 
the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price 
and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril 
on Election Day. As in many congressional races, the biggest variable 
is the White House scandal, which has injected fear and uncertainty 
into campaigns around the country. Other Democratic incumbents who 
Republican officials cite as locked in contests that are more competitive 
than expected include Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of 
Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost 
of Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York 
and Sander Levin of Michigan. Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional 
District, Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a 
tight race, said: ``This is a swing district that is sensitive to 
any tide or trend. It's something you think about a lot in connection 
with the president's troubles.'' The efforts of Price and Mrs. Carson 
to contain the Lewinsky debacle _ and their opponents' attempts to 
capitalize on it _ offer important clues suggesting how Clinton's 
problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country. 
Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with 
every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close 
to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the 
possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing 
their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon. 
And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal 
will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for 
the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts 
to prod their core constituencies to vote. In a reflection of the 
uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, 
the challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political 
novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: 
Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, 
has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal. ``Tom 
Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says. 
``This is not the time to be silent, Price. Where do you stand?'' 
But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging 
Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a 
more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he 
notes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 
percent of the time.'' Asked why he was not much raising the scandal 
directly, Hofmeister said: ``Don't murder somebody when they're in 
the process of committing suicide. There would be a danger if we went 
overboard.'' The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and 
Mrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they 
would want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would 
be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a 
visit. What if there was a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed 
a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative. ``Given the 
president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs. Carson said. 
And Price? ``I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said. 
``I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to 
start this time'' although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, 
the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, 
to stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump 
is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to 
Democratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days of campaign stops 
here in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal was rarely 
raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party. 
When a reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled 
as they were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating 
it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections 
in five weeks. As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside 
a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis 
last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired 
on disability, called him over to express outrage about the millions 
of dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton. ``It's pathetic 
to spend all of our money,'' said Derringer, who identified himself 
as an independent. ``It shouldn't have gotten this far.'' Hofmeister 
tried his best to make the Republicans' case. ``There has to be rule 
of law,'' he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing 
voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that 
the issue might even help her. To that end, she proudly informs audiences 
that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House 
by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. ``I was one 
of 63 members of Congress who voted against putting all that filth 
on the Internet,'' she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been 
``a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability.'' 
The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old 
real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but 
now favors Mrs. Carson. ``I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because 
I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing 
politics,'' Daly said. ``We'd like to see them go on with the people's 
business.'' Back here in the 4th District, Price has some reasons 
to be worried. He was first elected to the House in 1986 but, as a 
four-term incumbent, was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994 (only 
to win his seat back two years later). In addition, the district was 
redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do 
not know him well. Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton 
once again, Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote 
ground campaign of his career. Rather than engage Roberg over the 
Clinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial 
that emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers 
say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly 
nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort 
to break through the television clutter about the scandal. But the 
Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the 
event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: 
the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running 
commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting 
his doctorate in political science. At a coffee with voters in a wealthy 
enclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg opened his remarks by asserting 
that Clinton had ``lost the moral authority to lead.'' Yet none of 
those assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned 
about the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood.
