Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for re-election, 
went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept 
an award from mass-transit advocates. But the reporters who had gathered 
there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's 
back. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment 
of President Clinton. ``Look, I'm not going to make any comment with 
respect to that subject matter,'' D'Amato responded. ``I am not just 
a citizen. I am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a 
decision.'' But D'Amato is something else as well: a candidate in 
what may be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variations 
of his elliptical response can be heard in Senate races around the 
country, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar 
questions. All of which suggests that after the House voted Thursday 
to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races for the 
U.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the electoral 
equivalent of jury selection. If the House votes to impeach Clinton, 
the matter goes to the Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority 
whether to convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, 
the Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive 
force into the Senate contests. Voters, even those who support Clinton, 
expect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce 
Clinton's behavior, and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment 
is another matter; most polls show the nation is against it. The danger 
for Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility, 
the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which 
there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of whether 
he should be removed from office. For most of the strategists involved 
in the races, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment 
issue. Advisers to candidates of both parties said in interviews last 
week that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or 
should do on the issue to gain the advantage _ or guard against harm. 
``I can't tell how this one is going to go,'' said Mike Russell, a 
spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``This 
is a very surreal environment.'' Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 
are held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats 
in all. Republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce 
the 67 votes necessary for conviction, assuming such a vote were to 
go along party lines. Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, 
which seems almost unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss. Jennifer 
Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan 
newsletter, said that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidates 
has made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote 
on a presidential jury. But she and others are wondering if this may 
be about to change. This is difficult ground to measure. One of the 
central questions of this political year has been how Clinton's dealings 
with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time, politicians 
assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton, 
just as many Republicans did in November 1974, three months after 
President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder 
if the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite 
effect among some Democrats. ``That's the problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, 
the editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington. ``It's 
not that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where 
the general public stands on impeachment. The problem is that we don't 
know where the electorate stands on impeachment.'' And asking voters 
to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots 
in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a Republican 
consultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such strategies, he said, tend 
to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated 
voters. Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking 
is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, 
state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of 
the candidates and the composition of the electorate. If Democrats 
try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it 
would be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers 
of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president. In contests 
like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic 
candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera 
and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's 
behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment. Strategists 
in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective. 
``This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites 
and the public,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic consultant with clients 
in Wisconsin and the Carolinas. That kind of Democratic strategy might 
emerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and 
perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia 
and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment. On 
the other side, Republican consultants are telling their candidates 
to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment. 
The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into 
a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office. ``The 
White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe 
they would like to make this a referendum election,'' said Ed Goeas, 
a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year. ``Republicans 
certainly aren't going to let that happen.'' D'Amato responded to 
questions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants 
have been suggesting to their candidates. ``When and if that matter 
comes to the Senate, I will decide on the facts that are presented 
to me at that time,'' D'Amato said. ``It would be very premature for 
me to suggest any course of action without it being referred. Because, 
indeed, we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind.'' But 
Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting 
the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the issue. In a 
live telecast of the hearings, he said the president deserved a lesser 
punishment, such as censure or reprimand. And Schumer plans to campaign 
in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side. Schumer's media adviser, 
Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow 
as an issue. ``Senator D'Amato claims he does not want to share his 
opinion with the people of New York,'' Morris said. ``And if he doesn't 
have an opinion, he's the only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion.'' 
Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, 
Morris responded: ``We don't talk about what we're going to do. I 
wouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.''
