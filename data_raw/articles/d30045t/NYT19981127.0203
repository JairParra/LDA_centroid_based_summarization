News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in 
merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages 
are back in vogue. Even before that combination came to light, deal-making 
was fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate 
acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent. Driving the 
resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by 
major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues 
internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy 
will not plunge into a recession next year. There are also industry-specific 
issues, like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into 
one another's arms. But for investors, mega-marriages are not where 
the real money is to be made. Rather, it is among smaller companies, 
whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with 
stocks that again are near their peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil at close 
to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more 
than $140 billion _ off from April's peak of $244 billion but three 
times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling. 
Which industries are likely to witness the most mergers? Tom Burnett, 
director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm 
in New York, says more deals are a certainty in energy, which is suffering 
from low crude-oil prices. Burnett also says health care executives 
are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings. But smaller companies 
may be a better way to play the takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor 
of the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: 
``Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. 
The values are in small-cap stocks.'' Another reason is that deals 
involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath 
of antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking 
takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already 
partially owned by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration 
qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by 
Keyspan Energy. He also believes more deals are imminent among drug 
chains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, 
remain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another 
concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic &AMP; 
Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. 
Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores 
that is 55 percent owned by the U.S. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, 
France's largest supermarket chain. ``Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final 
are trading at just about book value,'' LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically 
occur above book value. Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, 
a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading 
near $39, close to its low for the year. The company has $30 a share 
in cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. 
After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell 
Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's 
cross-hairs.
