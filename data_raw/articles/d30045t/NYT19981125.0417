Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining 
their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday. 
It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the companies 
were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of 
revenue. A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial 
Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between Exxon, 
whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, 
and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk 
to their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger 
than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. 
Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. 
Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two 
parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken 
up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon was then known as Standard 
Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard 
Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which has a market value 
of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of $61.1 billion, 
have a history of being fiercely independence. Both have already cut 
back on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods 
when oil prices are low. But this has been a particularly unsettling 
year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude 
oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most 
oil companies have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable 
partners. This summer, British Petroleum announced a $48.2 billion 
agreement to buy Amoco Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil 
company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. 
``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski, an 
analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that a combination 
between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has 
been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that 
it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a ``well run company 
that likes to grow its own businesses.'' He added that the heads of 
both companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based 
in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief 
executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different 
personalities. ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two 
far-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas 
stations that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer 
enough money you can make anything happen,'' he added. Both companies 
are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive 
in the long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly 
tap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they were prepared 
to spend billions, they have held back because of the political and 
economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials 
and oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have 
had to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters 
in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Such exploration is very expensive, 
and even when large fields are found it often takes platforms costing 
$1 billion to bring the oil into production. Oil prices have been 
under pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent 
from the $20-a-barrel level because of growing inventories of petroleum 
and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there. On 
Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, 
to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 
12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15. Members of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, 
notably Mexico, have tried to stem the price drops with pledges to 
cut back on production. But those pledges have not always been honored, 
and rallies in the oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC 
members on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their 
production cutbacks, and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday. 
In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels 
a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels. 
The main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil 
prices from falling below $10 a barrel. Washington regulators said 
Wednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. 
The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's 
pending purchase of Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to 
receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which 
would review how much of the industry such a merger would control. 
Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of the 
possible merger. Some pointed to difficulties that the companies could 
face if they were combined. ``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be 
bigger, the answer is probably no,'' said Garfield Miller, president 
of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank 
based in New York. ``It is hard to say that there is anything in particular 
to gain.'' In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous 
similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses. 
``They really do overlap quite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do wonder 
what is the benefit of all that redundancy.'' Another investment banker 
in the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also 
questioned the rationale for the discussed merger. ``When you look 
at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But 
none of those reasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.'' But Amy Jaffe, 
an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for 
Public Policy, said the combination of the two companies would be 
logical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding 
for projects in Middle Eastern countries. ``This is a deal that makes 
sense,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``With this combined company, there is no 
project that would be too big.'' In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the 
merger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas 
of the world where they had little influence. ``There are a lot of 
complimentary assets where they are not redundant,'' she said. She 
said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence in Angola, while 
Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets in the Caspian Sea 
and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.
