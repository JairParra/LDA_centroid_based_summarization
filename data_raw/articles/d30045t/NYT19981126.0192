Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger 
or some other business combination, America's economic history is 
already being rewritten. In energy as in businesses like financial 
services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and 
technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. 
Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional 
pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago. Crude oil prices 
have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels, 
adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo 
25 years ago. As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting 
their costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue 
operating profitably with such low prices. Exxon and Mobil are the 
two largest, strongest competitors to emerge from the nation's most 
famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard 
Oil Trust. Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger 
than either of them. They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC 
made far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer 
to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further 
deals on this scale are inevitable. Executives at both companies did 
not return calls Thursday for comment on the talks, and it was unclear 
Thursday night what the outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree 
to become one, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about 
putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart. Even 
so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from 
combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than 
the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would 
do to raise them. ``The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the 
consumer,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could 
prove heaviest for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of 
the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, 
and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would 
be likely to lose their jobs. Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, 
with Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executives who have been preoccupied 
with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary. 
Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting 
era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of 
the 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in 
much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing 
further on already depressed prices. ``They're pitiful, helpless giants,'' 
said Ronald Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a biography of John 
D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giants are 
compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their 
huge, expensive international projects that are needed to develop 
oil reserves needed for the next century. Mobil, with $58.4 billion 
in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. 
But in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in 
Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match 
Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more. Oil companies 
have decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to 
revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, the Energy 
Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue 
to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5.50 
a barrel in the year 2000. And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending 
their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices. Moreover, improving 
technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions 
to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is 
on hand now. In response, many energy companies have already begun 
a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations. To further 
reduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop 
short of full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its 
European refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, 
resulting in annual savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco 
then formed a refining partnership in the United States. In the face 
of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the 
James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, ``if you're 
an Exxon, how do you compete?'' Though Mobil and Exxon might have 
high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United 
States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than 
before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s. Thousands of convenience 
stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, 
and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies 
through acquired companies like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil has been 
hunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive. He 
took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered 
buying up smaller companies. And he has made it clear that corporate 
or personal pride would never block a deal. In the European agreement 
with British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from 
the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos 
have gone up. As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an 
analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``If the price is right, 
egos will not get in the way.'' In the past, Mobil reportedly had 
further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as 
well as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture. 
The company was also interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began 
looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business. But no deals 
were reached. More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street 
that Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase 
of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said. ``I 
don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum 
had not pulled the trigger,'' he said. The British Petroleum-Amoco 
deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an 
expected $2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large 
as Exxon on the spot. There, Raymond has so far concentrated more 
on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies. Though 
Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's, 
some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb 
a company of Mobil's size. Only the largest oil companies can afford 
to take advantage of today's best opportunities. Finding new fields 
in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of 
Mexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more. Producing 
oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and 
money than many investors anticipated. In September, Noto was among 
the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington 
to greatly step up investments in his country, too. Noto spent from 
1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations 
including a huge refinery. But any new partnerships with the Saudis 
might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. Back when 
Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard 
Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York. Even 
after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained for several 
years in the same building in Manhattan. Chernow, the Rockefeller 
biographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already 
likely to be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio 
in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana. The break-up 
of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited 
as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. 
Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil 
to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. ``Exxon 
would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way 
Microsoft is,'' he said. In the energy business today, he added, ``there 
are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle.''
