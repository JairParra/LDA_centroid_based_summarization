It was new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and 
Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers 
and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed 
stocks up. Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news 
of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would 
create the world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stocks 
also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America 
Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-way deal involving 
Sun Microsystems. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers 
Trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday. ``There 
is no question that the merger euphoria is the headline,'' said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp. ``But 
the flow into mutual funds is also strong.'' Exxon rose 1 11/16, to 
74], while Mobil jumped 7|, to 86. Chevron, reflecting the bounce 
that other oil companies got from the merger news, climbed 5\, to 
85|. Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rose 3\, to 170, were 
the main drivers of the Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed 18.80 
points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,333.08. It now stands just 
41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for 
the week. Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which 
rose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It 
climbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new 
high, the second of the week. It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five 
trading days. Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 
11/16, to 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4|, to 80], and Microsoft 
pushed the Nasdaq index to its first new high since July 20. The technology-heavy 
index finished 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, at 2,016.44. 
It was up 4.6 percent for the week. Whether Friday's gains will stick 
will not be known before Monday. It was a shortened trading session, 
with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, 
at 257 million shares, made it the lightest day of the year. In the 
bond market, which also closed early because of the Thanksgiving weekend, 
the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 101 12/32. The 
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, 
fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday. Long-term and 
short-term yields all slipped lower this week despite new economic 
data that indicated the economy was stronger in the third quarter 
than expected and seems to be moving along at a good pace in the current 
quarter. This small recovery in the face of stronger growth is probably 
because new inflation numbers show that prices are in check and analysts 
are still forecasting that the economy will begin to slow down next 
year. Many analysts have noted during the eight-week stock market 
rally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that 
investors were buying again even though major financial problems around 
the world _ including a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin America and 
a troubled Russia _ have not been resolved. Johnson said he thought 
that investors, inspired by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate 
cuts in two months and by the new stimulus package in Japan, assume 
that these problems will be solved. ``Investors are looking over the 
valley and they like what they see,'' he said. But he worries that 
the financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997 and was 
intensified by the effective default of Russia in August, will not 
go away quickly. ``It seems that in every financial crisis, everybody 
gets the impression that the storm has passed,'' Johnson said. ``But 
it is never that easy.''
