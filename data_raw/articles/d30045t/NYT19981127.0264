The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday 
to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's 
largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``the prospects 
were good'' for completing an agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed 
Friday that they were discussing ways to combine. They cautioned, 
however, that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance 
they would reach one. The statement sent the stock of both companies 
surging, suggesting investors believe the companies will combine. 
Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 
percent, to $74.375. Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, 
rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86. Some analysts said that if the 
two giants reached an agreement, it was likely to be in the form of 
a takeover by Exxon of Mobil. Exxon is far larger and financially 
stronger. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate 
staff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, 
an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, said that the companies would probably 
make cuts to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. Sieminski 
and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 
15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation 
of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares 
up sharply. They said the transaction would probably be an exchange 
of Mobil shares for Exxon shares. Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price 
a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion. 
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe 
pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive 
of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep 
big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices. 
``This is one of the most intelligent chief executives in the business 
and a man of considerable ability but he inherited some serious structural 
problems in his company,'' said J. Robin West, the chairman of Petroleum 
Finance Co., a consulting group to the energy industry based in Washington. 
He said that Mobil's prime assets include the Arun natural gas field 
in Indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which has contributed 
up to one-third of Mobil's profits for years but is beginning to run 
down. The field, in production since 1977, supplies liquefied natural 
gas to Japan and Korea. Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly 
to cut costs and muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan, 
where it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz 
oil field, the payoff from such ventures is many years away. Other 
companies face similar strains. ``The challenge is to replace their 
crown jewels and grow in an increasingly competitive environment,'' 
West said. Noto has not been shy about sitting down with other companies 
such as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination 
made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a much stronger 
and bigger company than Mobil, he has not been immune to the strains 
on the global petroleum business. Those strains intensified this year 
when Russia's economic collapse raised the risks of Exxon's extensive 
exploration venture in that country. Exxon has also been more of a 
follower than a leader in huge projects in the deep offshore fields, 
where major finds have been made near West Africa and in the Gulf 
of Mexico.
