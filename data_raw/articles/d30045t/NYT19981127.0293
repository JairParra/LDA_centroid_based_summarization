Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed 
Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust 
lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that 
any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such 
a new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would further reshape 
an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the 
low price of oil. But the mergers and other corporate combinations 
are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust 
officials, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and 
Mobil. Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing 
the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said 
the boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to 
consider an agreement. Shares of both surged on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily 
present antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition 
in those areas is brisk. But in retailing and marketing operations, 
an Exxon-Mobil combination would be ``like Ford merging with General 
Motors, Macy's with Gimbels,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer 
in New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more 
than a decade ago. In the United States, the deal would come under 
the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton 
administration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor not 
seen since the 1970s. The agency has blocked a number of proposed 
mergers, such as the $4 billion combination of Staples and Office 
Depot, the two largest office supply discounters, and two deals involving 
the four largest drug wholesalers. On the other hand it has approved 
other big mergers, such as Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell 
Douglas. The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior 
official said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's 
Standard Oil trust before it was dismantled by the Supreme Court in 
1911. ``The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance, 
they will be able to get the competition of one another off their 
backs, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco,'' 
said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School 
of Law and an antitrust expert. ``It may be that we are looking at 
a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation 
on the national level 100 years ago.'' The Federal Trade Commission 
recently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco 
after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing 
operations in Hawaii and California. It is also considering the proposed 
$54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have 
to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon 
and Mobil. ``In the past, when there have been two mergers involving 
the same industry, the government has considered them together in 
deciding how to deal with them,'' said Terry Calvani, a former commissioner 
at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. 
But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, 
a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping 
retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses 
questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s. 
``It's a real test case,'' said Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy 
analyst at Bear Stearns. ``If the FTC let this one go through without 
major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't 
GM merge with Ford?'' While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed 
by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, 
Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing 
and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals. 
Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case ``could 
be so large that they are deal-breakers.'' Other analysts and lawyers, 
while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, 
said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations 
and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum 
of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials. 
``These are not absolute obstacles,'' said John Hervey, an analyst 
at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In the past, when two big oil 
companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states 
have almost always become involved in raising questions because of 
the high visibility of the local gas station. ``When a state attorney 
general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them 
are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain to raise questions,'' Axinn 
said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing 
and marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West 
Coast, where they also have big refining operations. Because the two 
companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping 
to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will 
take months for the regulators to sort out. The regulators examining 
such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether 
its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether 
the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in 
those areas. Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to 
permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production 
businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and 
a merger would not result in higher prices. Hervey said those markets 
are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major 
American and European oil companies is only 17 percent.
