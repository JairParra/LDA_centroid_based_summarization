NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at 
the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of 
them Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing 
of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people 
were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the 
Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul 
Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan. U.S. law provides for the trial 
in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American 
citizens, even if carried out on foreign soil.
