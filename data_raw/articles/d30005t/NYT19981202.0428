If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior 
aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators. They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan. The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, 
or hiding under government protection. As recently as 11 days ago, 
records show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New 
York notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden. Government 
officials adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of 
CS-1, which stands for ``confidential source.'' But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns 
were inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating 
with Saudi and U.S. authorities. In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses. The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East 
African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's 
commanders, ``almost made me explode. ``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns. Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and 
remains at large. The report was typed on a computer seized last year 
by Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week 
in U.S. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have 
charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist 
activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appears to have resulted 
from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of 
receiving a lesser sentence. There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete. In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
The source described taking ``an oath of allegiance'' to follow bin 
Laden's orders, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group, 
including its history and inner workings. The source told of private 
statements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members, encouraging them 
to attack U.S. troops and other citizens stationed in the Middle East 
and Africa. ``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source 
said, ``or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members.'' 
The government has also said in other court papers that the source 
helped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urging Muslims 
to kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not 
be reached for comment.
