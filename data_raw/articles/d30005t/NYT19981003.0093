The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials. The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives 
money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his 
terror network, the officials added. This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said. A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world. I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.'' U.S. officials 
say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi 
presence in Sudan since the missile attack. Officials said they were 
not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum. But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. 
The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his 
decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. In addition, more than 
100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn 
in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications. That year 
a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one 
against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his 
reports proved impossible to confirm. Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their 
initial suspicions about Al Shifa. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise 
missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they 
did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had 
begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's 
ownership was irrelevant. ``What we knew about the ownership was that 
a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. 
intelligence official. Still, after the missile strike, when Idris 
was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate 
his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A Sudanese 
expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously 
a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. 
He bought the Shifa plant in March. Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development. Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence. But Pendry 
denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial 
Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about 
the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. 
But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign.
