Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or 
``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi 
capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. 
They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any 
one for offenses related to national security, the officer said on 
condition of anonymity. Those arrested need not be taken to court 
for trial for up to three months. Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August. Under Taliban rules women may not study or 
work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including 
music are banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized 
the Taliban government in Afghanistan.
