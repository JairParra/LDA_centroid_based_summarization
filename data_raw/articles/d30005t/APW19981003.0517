MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest 
near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant. 
Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to 
turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their 
extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard 
Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing 
the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material. Quoting 
unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine 
reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far was not very 
strong. The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of 
an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague 
connections between Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl declined 
to comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked 
for more time just a precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge 
Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, 
including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in New 
York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass 
destruction.
