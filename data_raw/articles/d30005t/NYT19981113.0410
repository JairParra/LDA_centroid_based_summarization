One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge. According to 
the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the 
months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law. The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order 
bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying 
out assassinations. But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that 
the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.'' ``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House. Targeting infrastructure, 
officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of 
a terrorist group. ``Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable 
target,'' Leavy said. Senior administration officials said they never 
discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions. His death, 
they said in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a 
side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit. Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction 
between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking 
a group of people who command a terrorist organization. Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests. He has been linked 
to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues. ``We 
weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.'' 
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not 
retracted his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported 
that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use 
deadly force against terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization was 
a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the 
bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Last spring, officials 
said, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan 
to capture the Saudi exile. Officials said that at roughly the same 
time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military 
attacks against a terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered. The review, by the National Security Council, was the 
basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order 
banning assassinations. That ban was imposed by President Ford in 
1975, after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the 
CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and 
others. The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf 
of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage 
in, assassination.'' While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified 
ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over 
the years. In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist 
attack against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. 
The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. 
And in the Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs in an attempt 
to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. The legal review conducted 
by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future 
operations in similar circumstances.
