The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday 
of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his 
war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States 
retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps 
in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence 
sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's 
al Qaeda terrorist group. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. 
Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to 
investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United 
States has become insecure. ``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee 
his guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent 
of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice 
has been imposed, including the death penalty. ``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said. Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''
