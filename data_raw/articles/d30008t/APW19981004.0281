Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific 
leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of 
Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported 
Sunday. Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia 
for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph 
Estrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. ``I'm very concerned 
over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted 
as saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. ``I'm concerned 
because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed 
a lot for the benefit of his country.'' Anwar is a charismatic politician 
who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir 
on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began 
speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has 
been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia 
law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political 
persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised 
and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international 
attention to his case. ``Because of human rights involved _ and I 
think it is universal _ people should be given the chance to defend 
themselves,'' Habibie was quoted as saying in the interview conducted 
Saturday. ``People should not be tortured.'' Habibie said Anwar's 
dismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been 
proven.'' On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult 
for me.'' But he said he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not 
coming personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia.'' 
Like Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when 
Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international 
affairs circuit.
