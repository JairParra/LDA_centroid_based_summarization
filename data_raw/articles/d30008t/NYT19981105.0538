In little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this 
businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting 
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly 
be meeting in a more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued 
trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls 
on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly 
on investment from overseas. In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister, 
Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy 
that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion. 
Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy- 
makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would 
retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out 
when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise. Now, though, 
Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate 
that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund 
economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and 
there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again. 
``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls, 
the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director 
of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research 
organization here that helped draft the policies. ``But we want to 
see whether this is strongly sustainable.'' Critics said it was predictable 
that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. 
Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows 
and currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able 
to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, the 
mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results 
guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. With 
Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will 
have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin 
of Westerners. ``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,'' 
said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. ``There is 
no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to 
muzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China. Policy-makers 
in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit 
is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the 
region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it. So far, Indonesian 
officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised 
by the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity 
and open markets. But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy 
for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency 
measure. Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention 
that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial 
system. He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge 
fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive 
consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in 
Greenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on 
Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted 
a flight of capital out of that country. ``The LTCM fiasco really 
provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,'' 
Yusof said. With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia 
was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy. In addition to 
growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade 
balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods. Foreign investors 
have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted 
they would. While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to 
$142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the 
period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely. 
For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming 
one. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely 
due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian 
currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated 
by Sept. 30. The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in 
September, despite several reductions in interest rates. So the consumers 
who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into 
their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings 
are depleted. ``The argument was that by imposing capital controls, 
you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the 
supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S. Jomo, 
a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here. 
``But that's not happening.'' The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy, 
Jomo and others said, is its timing. With the Asian crisis more than 
a year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has 
already gone. The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors 
without even locking in the ones who used to be here. ``There is a 
case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls, 
but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,'' Jomo said. In fact, 
other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, 
have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency 
and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. Analysts 
liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that 
has come and gone. More important, the capital controls are slowing 
down much-needed corporate and banking reforms. The government's rescue 
of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going 
ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually 
scrap the much-criticized plan. The rescue of politically connected 
companies remains a tense issue here. On Monday, during the trial 
of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges 
of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's 
claim that he had approved the bailout. Anwar's sensational trial 
is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled 
from politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with 
his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he 
dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls. During boom 
times, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner 
language. In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying 
foreign currency traders ``are the cause of the currency turmoil,'' 
adding: ``They spread it worldwide. They precipitated the current 
recession in every country.'' But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has 
stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia. With 
protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this 
city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order 
to soothe the country's agitated population. ``Things will heat up 
if the economy does not improve,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor 
of political science at the University of Malaya. ``Then the whole 
question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue.'' In 
that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in 
two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host.
