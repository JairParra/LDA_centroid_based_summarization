After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and 
Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific 
summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend 
Anwar Ibrahim. Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the 
meeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month 
in the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy 
prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept. 
20 on corruption and illegal sex charges, then brought to court with 
a black eye and bruises. Philippine President Joseph Estrada told 
business and political leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he had 
not made up his mind. Estrada called Anwar his friend and said, ``I 
think all of us here believe that due process and human rights should 
be respected.'' Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away, 
his foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast 
Asian leaders held a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie passes 
up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving 
the country while there is no vice president, while there are so many 
problems to deal with.'' Habibie has already canceled a state visit 
to Malaysia, citing difficulties at home. The meeting was delayed 
for almost 90 minutes when a mechanical fault was discovered in one 
of two Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and 
his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. A ferry was chartered 
for the 45-minute sea journey. Habibie apologized when Estrada finally 
arrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel. Estrada replied, ``That's all 
right.'' The two men, who have each been in power less than five months, 
met alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass a fairer 
share of the country's wealth. Habibie took office May 21, hours after 
his predecessor and mentor, Suharto, was forced from power after national 
protests and street riots over Indonesia's collapsing economy.
