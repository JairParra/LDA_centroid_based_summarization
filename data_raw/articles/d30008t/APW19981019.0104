The last time the Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit to promote 
free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy 
wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Canada, the 
host country, was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on 
demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the 
time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy 
were the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging countries 
such as Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and comply with 
the tough economic reforms that the International Monetary Fund was 
demanding. My, how the challenges have grown, as the 21-nation Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in Malaysia. 
Japan _ the world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor 
_ is suffering through its worst recession since World War II, and 
that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, 
who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was driven out of power by a violent, 
pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country 
is in real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping with a steep 
downturn. And even though Clinton has promised to attend the APEC 
meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing an impeachment 
inquiry back home, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse 
still, Asia's economic crisis is showing signs of going global, and 
more and more economists are criticizing the IMF for the way it is 
handling its bailouts. Other well-respected economists are going even 
further, questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave 
some countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators. 
In fact, Malaysia isn't the only country trying self-defense mechanisms 
such as capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent a fortune investing 
in its stock market to ward off speculators. And Washington is trying 
to figure out what to do with hedge funds after watching its Federal 
Reserve help bail out a major one that was going under, and seeing 
the investments of others send the U.S. dollar into a tailspin against 
Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 
who made one of his typical anti-free-market comments during last 
year's summit, probably could have opened this year's with an ``I 
told you so.'' But even he is having major domestic problems. Mahathir, 
72, who is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his 
17 years in power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, 
in an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess. 
Instead of stepping aside, Anwar launched a reform movement across 
Malaysia that quickly led to big rallies demanding that Mahathir step 
down. The prime minister used riot police to thwart the protests, 
and jailed Anwar, charging him with corruption and sex crimes, and 
scheduling his trial for Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted during 
the Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and 
his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such 
as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. President 
B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada 
consider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plans to 
attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador 
for APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC members 
to meet in Malaysia as the Asian crisis ``ricochets around the world 
with no clear sign what will happen next.'' But he also said the leaders 
of the 21 APEC members should aim for a productive meeting. Wolf said 
such gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF bailout strategies 
and the free-market philosophy, to resolve bilateral disputes, and 
to continue to reduce tariff rates to help struggling countries improve 
their exports. ``This has been a lousy year in general. It has affected 
all of us. It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to 
solve the crisis right away,'' said Wolf. ``But we should welcome 
the chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's possible.'' 
So far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial 
crisis. But next month it hopes to complete a plan that would lift 
trade barriers in nine key industries: environmental products and 
services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, 
chemical products and telecommunications. Besides the United States, 
APEC, which accounts for half of all global trade _ consists of these 
members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, 
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During the Malaysia meeting, 
APEC also will include three new members: Russia _ one of the latest 
victims of the financial crisis _ Vietnam and Peru.
