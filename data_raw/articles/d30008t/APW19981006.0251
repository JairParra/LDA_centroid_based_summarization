The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement 
for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next 
month in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any 
time. But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's 
job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision 
was not expected quickly. The party leaders, who have been conducting 
a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar 
was fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High 
Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. 
The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday, 
aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has 
the most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had 
groomed Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from 
his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds 
he was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy 
and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year 
rule. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks 
of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and 
Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police 
to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and 
lawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked 
by the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent 
weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding 
riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons, 
arresting more than 100 people. ``They decided that the government 
should be brought down through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama 
news agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. 
He was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the 
UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised 
face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly 
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised 
the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia 
next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's 
visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, 
the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying. 
Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered 
hospital checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four 
charges of abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. 
His trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings. 
He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption 
count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in prison and 
a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each 
sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the 
Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the 
same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates 
and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released. 
The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates 
for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, 
which is close to the government, listed the favorites as Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. 
Other top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, 
a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as 
``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah 
Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh 
Hamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running.
