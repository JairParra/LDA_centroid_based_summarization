Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic 
planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry 
said Friday. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders 
summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation 
from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said. 
Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the 
understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an annual formality 
that allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host 
to avoid controversy with China. Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's 
annual meeting if Lee attends has forced him to send a stand-in every 
year since the inaugural summit in 1993. China claims Taiwan as a 
breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed 
to send their heads of state. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, 
Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will 
join in November.
