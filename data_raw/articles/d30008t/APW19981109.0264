The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world 
leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample 
local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit. 
It's expected to be a hot affair. Spicy delicacies on the menu are 
satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik, 
chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and 
fried rice ``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday 
editions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia 
Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leaders 
were expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18. APEC groups Australia, 
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, 
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam 
and Peru will also join APEC this year.
