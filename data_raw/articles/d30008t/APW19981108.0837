Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region 
advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms 
in their effort to restore stability. Among the necessary steps is 
for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make 
them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the 
officials suggested. The deputy finance ministers and deputy central 
bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila 
Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote 
regional economic stability. Many of Asia's economies have plunged 
into recession since that agreement. Collapsed currencies, weakened 
demand and higher unemployment now characterize a region that once 
boasted some of the world's highest economic growth rates. The worsening 
financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit 
in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. The summit is to take place on Nov. 17-18. In a 
joint statement, the officials cited risks including slower global 
growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening economy, and 
the need to speed up social programs to help the poor in the worst-hit 
countries. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International 
Monetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed their 
banking sectors. But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring 
as well. ``These are not easy things to do,'' he said. Meanwhile, 
Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime 
minister would declare ``a state of emergency'' after the APEC meeting 
ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday. Former Deputy Prime Minister 
Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct, 
made the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine. 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying he 
was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's ruling 
party. Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated 
because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's 
17-year rule.
