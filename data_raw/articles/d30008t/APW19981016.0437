The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned 
to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements 
in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes 
said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday 
after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President 
Joseph Estrada. ``They expressed their concern about what's happening 
and the statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told 
radio station DZXL in Manila. Brillantes said he explained that following 
the 1986 ``people power'' revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos, Filipinos' react ``strongly'' to ``real and perceived violations 
of human rights.'' ``I just explained our culture to them,'' he said. 
Anwar was fired as deputy premier in September and later arrested, 
appearing in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace. He 
says he was beaten by security guards. Estrada has expressed support 
for Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may 
not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month. 
He has also said Anwar should be held in house arrest during his upcoming 
trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied 
the charges, calling them politically motivated. On Thursday, Estrada 
told Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell her father ``not to waver 
because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian people.'' 
He said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not meant 
to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia. Brillantes said: 
``The expression of personal opinion is allowed in our culture and 
it is not surprising for that to happen.'' He also said ``there is 
no connection'' between Anwar's case and the summit meeting in Malaysia 
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ``We still consider, 
as expressed by our president, that APEC is important to us,'' he 
said. He did not say how the Malaysian officials reacted, but he said 
he was not reprimanded. Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislators 
said they plan to attend Anwar's trial, which opens Nov. 2. ``We feel 
that being observers to his trial will be our silent statement of 
our democratic aspirations for all Asia,'' the group said in a statement.
