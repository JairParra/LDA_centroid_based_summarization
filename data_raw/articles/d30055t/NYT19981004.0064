It is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems 
could the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political 
opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came 
undone Sunday. The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister 
Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist 
Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, 
imperiling the future of the center-left coalition. Officials in the 
prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet on 
Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political 
turbulence, though not to offer his resignation. If the Communist 
Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which 
passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government 
at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already 
injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic 
and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party 
of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision 
by Communist Refounding a ``misfortune for the entire country.'' Passage 
of the budget, he said, is essential ``to avoid disaster.'' Prodi's 
coalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists, known as the 
Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented 
followers. It is supported by Communist Refounding, a fringe group 
of hard-line leftists who broke with the mainstream Communists after 
they overhauled the party following the collapse of Communism in Eastern 
Europe. Despite frequent shocks, the alliance has held since 1996, 
glued together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements 
to allow Italy to adopt the single European currency. As the Jan. 
1 date approaches for the introduction of the new money, the euro, 
Italy must cut its key lending rates to bring them in line with those 
of bigger European neighbors, like Germany. A rate cut by the Italian 
central bank is generally thought to hinge on passage of the budget 
bill. If the bill is not passed, negative signals would be sent to 
global financial markets that are already upset because of the financial 
crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers 
were still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding 
deputies would break ranks and back the budget when it comes up for 
a vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group 
that rescued Prodi in June under similar circumstances and that is 
led by former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support 
the budget, thus at least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist 
Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed 
Prodi to the brink twice before. The party forced him to offer his 
resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, but then backpeddled 
after the party's rank and file protested. In June, the hard-line 
leftists again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in 
a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through 
with the help of Cossiga's party. But one of the leaders of that centrist 
group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the 
government generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly 
uncertain.
