Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament 
to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened 
with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The address 
to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by 
the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, 
center-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist 
Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support 
over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 
1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European 
common currency. Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if 
he lost the Communists' support. ``I've always acted with coherence,'' 
Prodi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
on the crisis. ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do 
political gymnastics.'' The break with Prodi's government divided 
Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned 
as party president Monday. He said the party's desertion of Prodi 
was ``wrong and dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow 
the party line. ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which 
could lead to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And 
with the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the 
right.'' If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, 
he would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to Scalfaro 
to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a 
new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something 
most analysts think unlikely. Working in Prodi's favor is the fact 
that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, 
including the Communist Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi 
would reopen negotiations that would win back the communists' grudging 
support, as he has managed to do in the past. Prodi's government has 
held together this long in large part because of the widely shared 
desire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of 
Europe's common currency, the euro. That happened earlier this year 
_ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. 
Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has outlasted 
all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints 
from 1983 to 1987. Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left 
coalition, but the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority 
in the lower house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset. 
It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending 
troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to resign a year 
ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. The 
crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made steep 
concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.
