Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting 
alliances. And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled 
government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. A 
leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist 
Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision 
to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender 
majority in Parliament. ``Prodi must realize that his majority no 
longer exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding 
Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after 
they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union 
in 1991. ``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the 
last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.'' Cossuta 
was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party 
in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded as having 
torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 years. But the 
leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, 
seems to have no such compunctions. On Friday, he told journalists 
that he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return 
the right to power. ``Sometimes you have to take one step back in 
order to take two steps forward,'' he said with a shrug. Until now, 
however, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view. 
When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over 
proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced 
to backpedal. Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
and coalition leaders to devise a strategy. He is expected to go to 
Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough 
votes for the budget. Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely 
to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line 
with Germany and other bigger European neighbors before the introduction 
Jan. 1 of the single European currency, the euro. But even if he gathers 
enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be left without 
a majority. After two and a half years in office, his government is 
the second-longest in the postwar era. But the fragile center-left 
coalition has held together mostly because Italians were united for 
the last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and 
government borrowing to meet the requirements for membership in the 
euro plan. Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly 
revived. Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist 
Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the 
coalition. If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices. He 
can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing 
the opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority without 
the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right 
party of Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue 
in June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO 
expansion. But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with 
the center-left majority that elected him in 1996. Cossiga also suggested 
to reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join 
a coalition led by Prodi. ``We wouldn't want this majority to get 
stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress,'' he said.
