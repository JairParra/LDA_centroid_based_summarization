Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left 
government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday 
to try to reach a consensus on a new government. Following the talks, 
which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name 
a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. If Scalfaro 
feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call 
early elections. Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament 
during the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be 
scheduled by December. Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier 
for the interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked 
the crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999 
deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate 
job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, 
who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence 
by a single vote. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless 
his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an 
unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. An alternative to 
Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, 
the largest party in Prodi's coalition. In the case of a so-called 
``technical'' government, the names of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A 
government of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period 
of approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European 
currency, the euro, in January 1999. Prodi presided over cost cuts 
that got Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlasting 
all but one other post-World War II Italian government in the process.
