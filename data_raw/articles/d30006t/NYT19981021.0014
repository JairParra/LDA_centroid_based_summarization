As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball 
Association and its players is weird even by sports standards. There 
is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season 
will be canceled. In this union battle it is the interests of the 
best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the 
discussion. And here it is some of the workers, not the management, 
who are considering trying to make the union disappear. The current 
arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. 
Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum, 
then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans. The number of 
players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, 
in NBA terms _ fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. 
This should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment business, 
not unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. 
Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. 
The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its 
own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When that was adopted, 
it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could 
pay. But it has not worked out that way. In the current negotiation, 
the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 
percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, 
and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players 
want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises 
for veterans. The union says it is worried about that middle class, 
but seems determined to preserve the free market. The league got its 
broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay 
this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to 
broadcast. (They will be paid back in later years, either through 
reduced fees or extra games to show.) Owners hoped the players would 
think management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with 
only a small part of the season canceled. But the union is acting 
unhurried. It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying 
the players had to meet first. Then there is the issue of union suicide, 
a tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995. The idea is that 
if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws 
for the owners to collude. The sky would be the limit. That tactic 
might fail. The courts could reject a union decertification vote as 
a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel 
free to offer less than the old union minimum. But if the players 
go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get 
going. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners 
this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. 
That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World 
Series was canceled by labor troubles. But fan memories are relatively 
short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever. With that in 
mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months.
