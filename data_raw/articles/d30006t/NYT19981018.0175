More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed 
contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during 
the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that 
may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have 
major ramifications on American sports-labor law. But neither the 
players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, 
John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds 
in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million 
in salaries. NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the 
decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated 
by appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if 
necessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that 
could prevent the players from getting paid for several months. The 
NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season 
because of the labor dispute. The league has other litigation pending 
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. If the players win the ruling, 
the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion 
was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining 
agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the 
matter. ``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit 
and the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive 
director. ``But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just 
means they have to pay 200-some players. And there is still other 
litigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a 
hollow victory.'' Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render 
his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. 
There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid. During the 
NBA summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file 
a grievance. Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked 
out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season. The union argued 
that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses 
about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player 
contracts. In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses 
in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding 
payment during a lockout. The league is relying on the basic tenets 
of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes 
or lockouts. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future 
negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a 
lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to 
reach a new agreement. If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there 
will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts 
to reach an agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid for 
not playing basketball. If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the 
reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement 
more quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference 
call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled 
before the players would back away from their ultimate goals. ``I'm 
not at all concerned,'' Hunter said. ``There's been no demonstration 
that there's going to be a change in our resolve. After the players 
saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA 
owners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be, 
they'd be willing to hock everything they've got.'' Another significant 
development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the 
dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents. ``I think 
it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people 
talking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's 
agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, 
said he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center 
Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece. ``We 
wouldn't look to void his deal with the team,'' Kauffman said. ``But 
we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until 
he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy 
commissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players' earning 
a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged 
last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player 
salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations 
since the lockout began July 1. But both sides have termed the figures 
in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether 
either side was willing compromise. ``I don't think we should get 
too carried away about the possibilities just yet,'' Granik said. 
``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the 
players at their word that they wanted to make some headway. But to 
call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed 
something that has no impact. As it stands, that can't be the solution.'' 
The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation 
to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players 
want to keep earning as much as possible.
