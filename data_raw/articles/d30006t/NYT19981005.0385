In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage 
in National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announced 
the cancellation of all 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations 
with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, 
league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel 
the first week of regular season games. While the decision had been 
expected for 10 days, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the 
owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part 
of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute. Both 
sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated 
training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts. Privately, 
officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled 
on Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike Major League Baseball, the 
National Football League and the National Hockey League, the NBA has 
never lost a regular-season game to labor strife. ``Since we're not 
even negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're 
going miss some part of the regular season,'' deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik said Monday night. ``We'll try and defer any decisions 
until the last minute, but right now it does not look good.'' The 
two sides will meet on Thursday _ their first official bargaining 
session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners 
walked out of a meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal 
from the players. Neither Granik nor players association executive 
director Billy Hunter sounded as if this week's meeting would go a 
long way toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to 
playing again. ``I don't think you have any choice but to miss games 
at this point,'' Hunter said. ``In fact, I think the they've intended 
it all along. They've locked us out, they've refused to negotiate 
and they've given us a proposal that's ludicrous.'' Not only are both 
sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is 
due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will 
rule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed 
contracts should be paid during the lockout _ but the owners and players 
also are making time to win public opinion before they test their 
fans' loyalties by canceling games. Monday in 11 cities throughout 
the country, the players are holding make-shift press conferences 
at training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, 
the union president, and several teammates will speak at SUNY-Purchase 
in Purchase, N.Y., where the Knicks train during the season. With 
training camp originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message 
from the players is clear: if the owners would call an end to the 
lockout, we would be ready to play today. About 100 players are expected 
to attend, speak and sign autographs for fans afterward. ``I wish 
they would put their energies into trying to negotiate a deal rather 
than the various other things that they've been doing,'' Granik said. 
The dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously 
divvy up $2 billion in income. It began last year with the contention 
by the owners that their employees were receiving more than their 
fair share of the pot. The owners were allowed to terminate the current 
agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player 
salaries reached 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income. 
The owners say that figure is currently hovering around 57.1 percent. 
Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of 
contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared 
a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their 
own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules 
governing the NBA's 29 teams. Called the Larry Bird exception, it 
was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign 
with the Celtics near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercised 
the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earning more 
than $30 million per season _ figures more than $5 million more what 
a team is allowed to spend on all its players. But with exorbitant 
salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and 
$100 million deals sprouting up routinely, the owners are determined 
to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a 
restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how 
much one player could earn. ``Last year, the players received about 
$1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals 
that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the 
next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement. ``Our proposals 
would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million 
and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000. Unfortunately, 
the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration 
to what we have offered.'' Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic 
projections, and shot down a number of new proposals presented to 
the players on Sept. 25. ``If they had left the current deal in place, 
we would have gotten much of that anyway,'' he added. ``All we're 
saying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap.'' Monday's 
decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the 
NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week 
of exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated 
that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 
million and $40 million. Decisions about the cancellations of regular 
season games are expected to be made next week, he added. A league 
official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two 
weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations. Thursday's 
bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the 
season on time. ``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have 
no reason to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said. Added Hunter: 
``Of course they don't expect much to get done. When Russ and David 
decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive, then 
something will happen. What they're banking on now is that the players 
are going to miss paychecks and cave in November. It's as if they've 
ingested something that has to pass. And once it passes, then they'll 
negotiate.''
