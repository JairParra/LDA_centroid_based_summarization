The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing 
sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came 
and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement. Still, a five-hour 
meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like 
two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association 
produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. Barring a 
major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full 
season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season 
games to labor strife in November. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, 
said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before 
deciding to cancel regular-season games. He also discussed the possibility 
of a significantly shortened season. ``We haven't made a determination 
that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative 
season,'' Granik said. ``But we recognize that beyond a certain point 
we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season. 
``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. 
We have a few months before we have to face that decision.'' Perhaps 
the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown 
Manhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session over the league's 
latest proposal to the players. Patrick Ewing, the union president, 
and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the 
meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union 
lawyers. No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern 
and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies 
of a two-week-old proposal to the players. At one point before the 
two parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices 
and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a 
participant in the meeting said. But the two were seen shaking hands 
and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 p.m. ``There 
was some venting from both sides,'' Hunter said. ``We've been placid 
and very respectful. Today, we took the coats off and we were inclined 
to take the gloves off a little bit. Having done that, I think it 
kind of loosened up both sides.'' Hunter added: ``Did anybody blink 
today? They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can 
find during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or 
another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing 
we might be open to something else. We're looking at their body language, 
too. I don't think that they're ready to make a deal.'' The last formal 
meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owners 
abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players.
