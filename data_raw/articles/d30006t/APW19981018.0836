In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association 
and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 
more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during 
the lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about 
dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed 
to appeal if they lose. The league already has sued the players over 
Feerick's jurisdiction. ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the 
spirit and resolve of the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's 
no guarantee that it will end the lockout. ``It only means they have 
to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent 
to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in 
order to avoid payment. ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at 
most it's a hollow victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. 
15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said. If the owners win, it will 
remove the last wild card the players had been holding. The sides 
have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a 
superstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made a counterproposal 
Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. 
Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, 
then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. 
It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union 
is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee 
in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. ``We've got to get a sense 
of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and 
what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' 
Hunter said. The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout 
was imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they 
would not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, 
the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from 
being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting 
lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento 
Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract 
in 1994, and it was approved by the league. The union used the existence 
of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected 
themselves similarly. Most players are due to receive their first 
paychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them 
to be paid over the summer. None has received a paycheck. The NBA 
argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay 
from employees during a lockout. The league also called former union 
director Simon Gourdine to testify. He said it was his understanding 
when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would 
not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose 
a lockout.
