The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute 
with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 
season. It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that 
it will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, 
Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half 
hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to 
cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players 
association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of 
a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to 
by Friday. ``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible 
to salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. 
``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.'' After 35,001 games without 
a blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey League, the National 
Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost games to 
a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period 
would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the 
season starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether 
to make further cancellations. ``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' 
said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. ``I consider it to be a collective 
failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I 
do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game. 
And I believe this is.'' The decision came after what both sides agreed 
were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout 
on the player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president 
Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe 
Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik 
and five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden 
president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon 
Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of 
Phoenix. The talks featured what the players association implied were 
a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate 
the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the 
owners. The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 
billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point has been the 
owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation 
of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue 
growth. While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry 
Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount 
of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address 
the exception in their taxation proposal. The main points were as 
follows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above 
$18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised 
their Bird rights. For example, if a player made $20 million, the 
team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most 
likely be distributed to low-revenue teams. ``There could be provisions 
made for some players,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel 
for the union. ``We don't want to do anything that would encourage 
Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feels 
the same way.'' The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed 
by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly 
as liberal. _ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league 
pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure 
over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the figure 
was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work 
with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season. But the 
players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at 
least $2 million before the credit goes into effect. _ Also, if the 
63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises 
would take effect for multi-year contracts. Players would either get 
raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. The 
union said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries 
in line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement 
because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent 
figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners 
to agree to such a proposal. _ Teams would get a right of first refusal 
on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning 
a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the 
first four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three 
years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his 
Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into 
an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. _ Finally, 
the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. Details of 
testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took 
place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision 
the owners included in their last proposal. In return for the concessions, 
the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 
_ and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every 
team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year 
for the average salary _ currently $2.6 million. ``We're buoyed by 
the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,'' 
the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. ``I don't know 
if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers 
in the eye and say we made a valiant effort.'' Asked if the players 
would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games, 
Hunter added: ``It's not about us blinking. We want to reach an agreement. 
We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our 
position all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.'' 
Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month 
and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason 
games. He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of millions of 
dollars.'' ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system 
can address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added. ``But 
there's some possibility.'' Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to 
go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve 
the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to 
spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.'' 
Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent 
a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered 
out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole 
notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record. 
Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. ``I'd like to think 
these our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said. ``But unless 
this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, 
I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.''
