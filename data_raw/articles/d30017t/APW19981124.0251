Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable 
to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program 
representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea is suffering from 
a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with 
weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition 
in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. ``There 
is enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor to access 
it. The problem is poverty,'' Davies said. The WFP is currently supporting 
1.7 million hungry Cambodians _ about 15 percent of the population 
_ with food-for-work and direct assistance programs, but Davies said 
he fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to 
eat every day. ``The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse 
in North Korea,'' Davies said. ``The situation is much worse than 
most people recognize.'' According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent 
of Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 
20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. By comparison, a similar 
survey of North Korean children under 7 found that 65 percent are 
stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. Cambodia has 
produced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects 
another this year, but WFP statistics show that 25 percent of rice-growing 
areas account for 75 percent of the surplus. The majority of Cambodian 
farmers are not producing enough to keep their families fed and are 
being increasingly saddled with debts incurred when they run out of 
reserves before harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders in rural Cambodia 
typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice 
at harvest time, giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next 
crop season. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of 
modern child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded 
health and education sectors in Cambodia _ have exacerbated the food 
security problem, Davies said. Davies urged the new government to 
substantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and 
rural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's 
food crisis. ``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation 
with the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said. Cambodia 
typically earmarks about half of its annual budget to defense and 
security. In the 1998 budget, education was allocated 6.5 percent, 
health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements 
to the three ministries are often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted 
amount as annual revenues fall short of expectations, according to 
aid workers. A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health 
ministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from health 
officials and the U.N. World Health Program. The draft was later readjusted 
to provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in health spending.
