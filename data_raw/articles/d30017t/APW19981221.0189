Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had 
rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure 
a famine in their reclusive country. A police official in the Jilin 
city of Tonghua, near the North Korean border, said the North Koreans 
were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in 
China, had formed criminal gangs or engaged in prostitution. The official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied reports in the South Korean 
press that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum 
in forcing the refugees back across the border. He said they had crossed 
into China seeking food, not because of political repression in North 
Korea. Citing a North Korean human rights group and Japanese tourists 
visiting the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday 
that 150 North Koreans had been sent home from China, despite having 
presented petitions for political asylum. North Korea is entering 
its fourth winter of chronic food shortages, having harvested only 
3 million tons of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum 
needed by its 23 million people.
