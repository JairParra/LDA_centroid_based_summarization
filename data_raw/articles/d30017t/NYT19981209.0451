More than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown 
in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in 
North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically 
and mentally impaired, a new study by international aid groups has 
found. The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North 
Korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, 
who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population 
of this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shocking 
findings, researchers from the World Food Program, Unicef and the 
European Union found that, because of long-term food shortages, a 
staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted 
growth. They have discovered that, despite a huge international food 
aid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is widespread 
among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development, suggesting 
that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop 
normally and that the losses can never be recovered. Separately, international 
medical workers from groups like the Red Cross, have begun to document 
how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by 
a breakdown in public health services. Even basic water purification 
systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, 
Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe 
diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food 
they have. As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly, 
granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six 
months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger 
haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys 
and observations by foreign aid agencies. Past assessments of the 
magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered 
flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of 
North Korean refugees who had fled into China. And while the researchers 
and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence 
of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions 
that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did 
find was in many ways equally disturbing: A population withering after 
nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition 
that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation 
irretrievably lost. ``Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation 
is very grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for 
Asia of the World Food Program, which has taken part in the research. 
``To me this is a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year, 
and probably a lot drop off. But the totality is very hard to gauge.'' 
For three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally 
permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random 
sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid 
data on the crisis. They found that 62 percent of children under 7 
had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 
of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition. This 
means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, 
because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential 
first year. The researchers said that available scientific data suggest 
that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea. ``Even if 
the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that 
the country will fully recover from what we saw,'' said Judit Katona-Apte, 
a senior program adviser for the World Food Program. ``People will 
be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited 
in their mental capacities.'' Likewise, when Red Cross representatives 
this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics 
where they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable 
for human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation 
in North Korea. ``But of course they drink it _ they have no choice,'' 
he said during a recent trip to Beijing. ``There is a very close relationship 
between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector 
that's in very bad shape.'' Virtually all the children under 7 who 
are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said. None of the aid groups 
has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the 
North Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts 
agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three 
million have died prematurely since the food shortages began. But 
public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult 
to tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick 
starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so 
that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an 
ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal. Still, there are 
some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted by the World 
Food Program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked 
by the government, 10 percent had a parent who was dead. In this fall's 
independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight 
of North Korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children 
under seven. In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had 
stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children 
were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their 
height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the 
study. That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and 
puts North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of 
malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as 
that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent 
malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways 
understates the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe 
poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North 
Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed. ``Even in war-torn 
countries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said. ``It's 
hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.'' 
The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied 
only children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food 
donated from abroad. After three years of food donations, many foreign 
aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries 
and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings 
are failing. So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing 
elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 
7 to 12. ``We have reason to believe that many people are suffering 
and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting 
weaker and weaker,'' Swedlund said. There are now more than 100 Westerners 
living in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term 
hunger is readily apparent there. ``If you walk down the street in 
Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three 
years,'' Swedlund said. ``She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.'' 
Dr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and 
the Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean 
kindergarten last year. ``There were these two children sitting at 
a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin 
and they had patchy hair,'' she said. ``And they were just sitting 
there working. This is accepted as normal! They are in school, and 
they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation. 
If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.'' 
But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that 
option does not exist, she and others said. Many Korean doctors do 
not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before 
this decade. And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper 
nutritional supplements. Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, 
had no glass to replace broken windows and were ``colder inside than 
out,'' having received no coal since 1994. He said that even in hospitals, 
sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, 
because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run 
water pumps. He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to 
address those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients 
and $1 million on water treatment. With few other options, vast numbers 
of North Koreans have resorted to eating ``substitute food,'' hard 
cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans 
and sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks 
and straw. ``This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Swedlund 
said. ``It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'' Doctors 
in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating 
this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, ``If you're 
very hungry, it fills your stomach.'' Although the North Koreans date 
their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, 
the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical 
records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began 
several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel 
and fertilizer. North Korea is a mountainous country, with less than 
20 percent arable land. It has been a food importer for decades, mostly 
from the former Soviet Union, but also from China. ``The country has 
to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem 
and can't just be blamed on the weather anymore,'' Ms. Cheng-Hopkins 
said. Still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive 
government for slowly loosening its restrictions. Swedlund said that 
after three years in the country, the international Red Cross, which 
collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found officials 
increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical 
records and bring up problems. Travel is still restricted. There are 
more than 100 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which 
aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to 
provide food or medical supplies. Still, the number of counties open 
to the workers has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has 
improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections 
were now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional 
survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at 
random. Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said 
they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation 
and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently. 
``I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh,'' 
Dr. Katona-Apte said. ``But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're 
still really limited in what we can see.'' Swedlund said it was unlikely 
that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different 
from the open ones. And while some have surmised that the closed counties 
might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted 
North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas 
for national security reasons. ``One thing I've learned is how important 
national security issues are to the North Koreans,'' said Swedlund, 
a retired admiral in the Swedish Navy. ``And I really think these 
areas are important from that standpoint,'' he added, going through 
a map of closed areas and describing what Western intelligence experts 
know about military installations there. He also rejected the notion 
that the North Korean military is stealing donated food, a charge 
leveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily 
pulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions 
on groups working there. Now that aid groups say they are starting 
to get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope 
to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months. And they are 
still analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice as likely 
to suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother 
was dead was malnourished. ``A generation of North Korean children 
is already scarred for life,'' said Astrid Heiberg, president of the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 
in an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. ``We need 
to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe.''
