Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North 
Korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering 
malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday. Several years of flooding 
and droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged 
North Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, 
communist nation. A survey carried out in September and October also 
showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, 
with a body weight too low for their height. That figure, which reflects 
ongoing shortages, is exceeded in Asia only by Bangladesh, India and 
Sri Lanka. Eighteen teams, each headed by a foreign official from 
the World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the European Union, 
carried out the study. They measured the weight and height of 1,800 
North Korean children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly 
selected in areas where aid agencies have access. Those areas cover 
around 70 percent of the population. It was the first ``technically 
sound survey'' of the problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters. 
The most alarming findings were for toddlers aged one to two, 30 percent 
of whom were acutely malnourished. At that age, ``malnutrition can 
permanently impair physical and intellectual growth,'' said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, 
WFP director for the region. Children in North Korea's three largest 
cities _ Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their 
counterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys 
were almost twice as badly affected as girls.
