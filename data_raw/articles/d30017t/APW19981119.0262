Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 
athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South 
Korean officials said Thursday. It will be the largest sports delegation 
the communist country has sent abroad in recent years. North Korean 
Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will 
compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, 
women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. 
Chang made the remarks in an interview published recently by the Chosun 
Shinbo, a newspaper run by pro-North Korean residents in Japan, said 
Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained the report. Chang said North 
Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 
2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, 
in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. It sent only 18 athletes and officials 
to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February. Naewoe is run 
by South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes 
in monitoring communist news media. Three years of floods and drought 
that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and 
planned economy, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed 
its 23 million people.
