Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year 
than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. 
North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain 
to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 
2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program 
said. Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for 
this year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi 
told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea. ``It may be 
worse than last year.'' Poor harvests, economic collapse and three 
years of floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages 
in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid. Fertilizer 
is lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, meaning 
most planting and harvesting must be done by hand. ``Every year it 
gets worse,'' Ngongi said. But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi 
said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to 
which the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people 
who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. Most of those receiving 
WFP aid are children aged between 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi said 
the government cited security concerns _ notably the lack of a peace 
treaty with its rival South Korea _ for its decision. The government 
said the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spent four 
days inspecting WFP relief efforts in North Korea, said people generally 
looked better than during a visit last year. But he also said he could 
see that ``a large part of the population is very weak.'' ``Everybody 
has been consuming at a very low level. So they may not be severely 
malnourished, but they are not well nourished at all,'' he said. U.S. 
officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of North Korea 
this summer said 2 million people may have died because of famine. 
Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10 or 
11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old. About 30 percent 
of children in one primary school he visited were not in class. ``A 
lot of the children were too weak to come to school,'' he said. But 
Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives. ``A lot of people are 
alive today thanks to the international community's support,'' he 
said.
