The founder of South Korea's largest conglomerate plans to visit his 
native North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company 
officials said Thursday. The visit has been delayed a month because 
of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of 
the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June. North Korea 
claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed 
them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them 
to the North. Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry 
of National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other 
cattle being raised at its ranch on the west coast. The ministry later 
acknowledged that lumps of rope were found in the stomachs of some 
cattle on the ranch, but said the material didn't kill the animals 
donated to North Korea. It blamed the deaths on stress caused by the 
long shipment by truck to the North. The South Korean government said 
it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North 
retracted its accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister 
Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying 
that ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue 
of the dead cattle is cleared.'' Kang said the North's letter ``cleared 
a stumbling block for Hyundai's additional cattle donation.'' During 
his visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on details of Hyundai's 
plan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the North. 
The tours, originally scheduled to begin in September, have been delayed 
because of cost, security and other matters. Hyundai hopes to send 
by ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for four-day tours of Diamond 
Mountain on the North's east coast beginning in November. Animosity 
and distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The Korean states were 
separated into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. 
They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.
