North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages 
with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable 
illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. The officials 
warned against international complacency and hostility toward North 
Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country 
shows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its 
ruined economy. ``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any 
part of the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary 
of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting 
the aid agency's operations in North Korea. She and other Red Cross 
officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine: 
electricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time; 
the elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation 
of children stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and 
5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, from bakeries to government 
ministries, people were being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans 
mixed with acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg 
said. Heiberg likened the additives to ``cattle food'' and noted that 
doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures. ``This 
is really part of the daily life,'' she said. ``You would not give 
them to your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get 
cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning.'' 
Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated 
North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering 
from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners. With few goods 
or money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the country lacks sufficient 
fertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts for machinery. The Red Cross 
inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's 
main vegetable. The grain harvest is finished and by U.N. estimates 
little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough 
to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people. 
As the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics 
show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened 
patients unable to recover from operations and sickness, Heiberg said. 
Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter 
may ``take a toll'' on the weakened population, she said. One 10-bed 
hospital in the countryside was keeping only three patients at a time 
because it did not have food to care for more, said Heiberg. The Red 
Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential 
medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea. Food aid is 
largely being turned over to U.N. agencies.
