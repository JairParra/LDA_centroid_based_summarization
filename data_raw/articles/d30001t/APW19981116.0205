Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen 
ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return 
until a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly. ``This will not be a repetition 
of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers,'' said Hun 
Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. ``When we had 
two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were 
made more politically than technically.'' Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya 
revealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control 
the foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice 
and information. The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet 
Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results 
of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. 
Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will 
be the key to a stable coalition. ``I consider this a remarriage,'' 
Ahmad Yahya said. ``They have to be careful with the way they work 
and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results.'' 
Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in 
the election, was left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent 
critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament 
have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their 
security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Authorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A 
police general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspects 
have been identified, but he would not reveal names or their political 
affiliation.
