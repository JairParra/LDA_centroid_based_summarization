Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.'' Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was 
forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest 
after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. 
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud 
and intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls. Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly. The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly.
