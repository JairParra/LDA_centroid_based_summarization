Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday 
to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls 
illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Meanwhile, it says, the old government is holding power illegally. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. ``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote. ``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.'' After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees. ``There have been 
reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of 
those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' 
Prak Sokhonn said. ``Some (opposition politicians) have wanted the 
United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them.'' The U.N. 
secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors 
to opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to participate 
in the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. ``Our office 
has not received any official request for that operation to be started 
up again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction 
to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said.
