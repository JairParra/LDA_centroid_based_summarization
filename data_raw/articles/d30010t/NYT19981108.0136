On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left 
for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye 
to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. Relatives 
say that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village near Jerusalem 
showed no sign that he was heading for a suicide mission with his 
brother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. Their 
car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, killing 
both men and wounding 24 people. ``Don't grieve for me,'' he wrote 
in a farewell note, according to relatives who found it later. ``If 
you cry, cry with happiness that I'm a martyr. Don't serve bitter 
coffee, serve sweets. I'm going to Paradise.'' At the family's stone 
house outside Jerusalem on Sunday, visitors paying condolence calls 
were served sweet juice, not coffee, as Sughayer's relatives tried 
to make sense of what he had done. The young man, once an ace student, 
had come of age in Israeli prisons. Jailed for a year at age 15 for 
stoning Israeli cars during the riots of the Palestinian uprising, 
he was imprisoned again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years 
for similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. Relatives 
said he was an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by Islamic militants 
with whom he was jailed. Sughayer came out of prison more devout, 
and hardened by mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis, relatives 
said. His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about 
the glories of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer. ``They 
sowed it in his heart,'' he said. ``He wanted to be a martyr in the 
cause of God.'' But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, was not 
so apparent when Sughayer was freed seven months ago. ``He seemed 
normal,'' said his brother. ``He went to work at the grocery store, 
he finished his high school classes and he wanted to enroll in the 
university. He was supposed to take a driving test in a few days. 
If he was planning something, we didn't see it.'' He would stay up 
late at night after work, studying the Koran and praying, but he showed 
no outward signs of rage toward Israel. ``He would joke about things 
and say that whatever happens is God's will,'' said a brother-in-law, 
who insisted on anonymity. ``He was an easygoing guy.'' Last Thursday, 
Sughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it near his house. 
When someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family 
members assumed it was one of the stolen vehicles often found here. 
On Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his brother-in-law 
and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from his village near 
the West Bank town of Jenin. Tahayneh had his own score to settle 
with the Israelis. His leg had been amputated after he was shot in 
a confrontation with Israeli troops during the uprising, his relatives 
said. The Fiat was loaded with explosives, and the two men drove to 
the market. That evening, when concerned members of the Sughayer family 
gathered to await news of their missing relative, a man arrived and 
told them that he had sold his car to Youssef the previous day. It 
was a red Fiat, the same car they had seen near the house, and the 
same type of car that news reports said had exploded in the marketplace. 
At midnight, Israeli security forces raided the house and interrogated 
family members. The last, grim pieces of the puzzle fell into place. 
``Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking together,'' 
said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with him past midnight 
at the produce store. ``He asked me about someone who had moved his 
hardware shop to another village, about how he was doing. Earlier 
we ate together, and we talked about giving charity to the poor. He 
wasn't nervous.'' ``He had plans for the future,'' Ali continued. 
``Maybe the people in his group convinced him to do this, and he could 
not refuse. We did not expect this from him.''
