The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that 
it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, 
which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight. Palestinian 
officials said they had jailed several of the small but radical group's 
members from the West Bank, and raided and then shut down a nursery 
school linked to the organization in Bethlehem, which is controlled 
by the Palestinians. The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, 
which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security 
accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as 
members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli 
security control. Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, the Damascus-based leader 
of Islamic Holy War, said ``martyrs'' from his movement had carried 
out the Jerusalem attack in response to Israel's settlement policy 
and ``Judaization'' of the West Bank. He spoke in an interview with 
Monte Carlo Radio, an Arabic station broadcasting from Paris that 
is widely listened to in the Middle East. A leaflet signed by the 
group and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem said the ``heroic attack,'' 
in which 24 people were injured and the 2 bombers killed, had been 
carried out ``to confront the great conspiracy that aims to liquidate 
the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements 
of submission.'' Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have 
denounced as a sellout of Palestinian rights the 1993 Oslo self-rule 
accord and the latest agreement, known as the Wye Memorandum, named 
for the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where the deal was worked out 
with strenuous American mediation. Shallah's claim of responsibility 
from abroad contrasted with the muted response of Islamic Holy War's 
leadership in the Gaza Strip, which has reportedly given commitments 
to the Palestinian Authority to refrain from such attacks. ``We have 
no knowledge in the movement about the operation that occurred in 
Jerusalem,'' said Nafez Azzam, a senior leader of Islamic Holy War 
in Gaza. ``From its conditions we consider it likely that it was an 
individual effort.'' The Palestinian cabinet, in a statement issued 
after a meeting on Friday night, accused ``foreign forces'' of standing 
behind the attack. One cabinet member, who declined to be identified, 
pointed a finger at Iran, saying a search of one bomber's home had 
uncovered a letter he had written to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei, expressing condolences for the recent killing of several 
Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. Iran, which has backed militant 
Islamic groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace efforts, has denounced 
the Wye agreement, branding Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, 
a traitor to the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cabinet promised 
to crack down on the militants, who it said were jeopardizing the 
recovery of Palestinian land and hopes for statehood by giving Israel 
a pretext to postpone carrying out the Wye accord. The Israeli Cabinet 
suspended a meeting to ratify the agreement after the bombing, demanding 
that the Palestinians conduct an ``all-out war on terror.'' Israeli 
officials had no comment Saturday on the measures taken by the Palestinian 
Authority on Friday. The Wye agreement calls for an Israeli troop 
withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for specific 
Palestinian measures against violent militants. A Palestinian security 
official said several Islamic Holy War members were arrested in the 
West Bank on Friday night. Arrests were also reported in the Gaza 
Strip. Itaf Alayan, a supporter of the group who runs the Islamic 
Purity Nursery in Bethlehem, said Palestinian officers had raided 
the school and confiscated videotapes and educational cassettes before 
locking it up. The two bombers were identified as Youssef Zughayer, 
21, from Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh, 
24, from Silat al-Harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. Both 
had served time in Israeli jails and were known to be members of Islamic 
Holy War. ``We never thought he would do something like this,'' said 
Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. ``We condemn such acts, but the 
only thing we can do now is to say may he rest in peace.''
