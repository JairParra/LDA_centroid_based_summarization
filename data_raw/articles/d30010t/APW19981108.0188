Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to crack down on militants, 
Israel is demanding that the military wings of two radical Islamic 
groups be outlawed, while the Palestinian Authority insists it has 
already banned them. Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security 
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past 
week, but has hit various snags. Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put 
off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in 
Jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. 
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. David Bar-Illan, 
a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday 
that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw 
the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group 
Hamas. Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military 
wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad were 
outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But Bar-Illan said 
the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a law. ``Why did 
Mr. Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if he has already 
done it?'' he asked. The Wye memorandum states that the Palestinian 
Authority ``will inform the United States fully of the actions it 
has taken to outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, 
as appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and 
their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the 
areas under its jurisdiction.'' A Palestinian security official, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said a joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting 
was held Saturday night to discuss security in the wake of Friday's 
attack. Participants included the head of the Palestinian intelligence, 
Amin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, 
Mohammed Dahlan. The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was 
brought up in the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat 
during a phone call, the official said. The Palestinians said they 
could ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either 
Israelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as political 
movements. Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides. 
Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been 
sweeping enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel 
of failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the 
attack, because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, 
and had recently served time in Israeli jails. Israel as a rule is 
harshly critical of the Palestinian Authority's security efforts when 
attackers come from Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released 
from Palestinian prisons. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister 
Freih Abu-Medein accused Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext 
for delaying implementation of the peace accord. ``This attack is 
a gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said. ``All the time he is praying 
to God to help him ... to escape from the agreement.'' Under the accord, 
Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of the territory in the 
West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for various security steps. 
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that the 
Israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in coming days. ``I estimate 
that the government will meet this week and will accept the decision 
of the majority (in favor of the agreement),'' he said.
