A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday morning in Jerusalem's 
Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis shopping for the Jewish 
Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21. The Islamic militant 
group Hamas, which has tried to stop the peace agreement, claimed 
responsibility, police said. In response to the attack, the Israeli 
cabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until there ``is 
verification that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.'' 
The Israeli Cabinet also announced it will begin to build houses in 
the controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had held up the work in recent months 
in an apparent attempt to not disrupt negotiations with the Palestinians. 
Aides to Netanyahu were not immediately available for comment. The 
Cabinet ministers had just begun a second day of of talks on the peace 
agreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance to the market 
and just meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing last year. 
In Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about 
9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda market, just 
meters (yards) away from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997. 
Witnesses heard a series of small explosions. Yair Cohen, 43, said 
he was buying cookies when he saw a car driving slowly, with smoke 
coming out of the hood and exhaust pipes. ``People started to shout 
`car on fire.' After a while, we heard a blast, and something hit 
me in the stomach,'' said Cohen who was treated for minor injuries 
at Hadassah Hospital. The car was a mass of twisted metal sitting 
in the middle of the main intersection outside the market. Flames 
shot 100 feet (30 meters) in the air. A charred corpse, covered by 
a blanket, lay several meters away. Streams of soot-black water ran 
in the street. Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, 
in a pool of blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body 
with sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags. ``There 
was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border 
policeman who was patrolling the market and was lightly injured. One 
heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an ambulance, weeping. 
Three paramedics talked to her, persuading her that she did not need 
medical treatment, and after a few moments she climbed out of the 
vehicle again. Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held back 
the crowds. ``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted. Just a block 
away from the blast, shoppers went about their business. One young 
woman shopper said: ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this 
happens.'' Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the 
Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. ``This is a crime and 
whoever commits this, hurts the interests of the Palestinian people.''
