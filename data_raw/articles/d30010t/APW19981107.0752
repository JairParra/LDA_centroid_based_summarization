A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel 
would continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, 
including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector 
of the city. ``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in 
every part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters 
in Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.'' Har Homa 
is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab 
east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to have as the capital of 
their hoped-for independent state. Groundbreaking at the site led 
to angry Palestinian protests and a breakdown of peace talks in March 
1997. Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the latest Israeli-Palestinian 
accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and 
his remarks about building on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation 
by the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment. U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu by phone that she expects 
Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few days 
despite the market bombing, Channel Two television reported Saturday. 
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for 
the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the new 
peace accord. ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going 
to be the last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations. 
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist 
enemy.'' An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus 
confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed 
responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based 
Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security sources and the families of 
the dead bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. 
At least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up 
since the bombing, the sources said. Palestinian political leaders 
said Israel should not use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed 
the two assailants and wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the 
peace process. One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians 
do more to fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. 
The Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from Israeli-controlled 
areas and that Israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility 
for the attack. The Israeli military said it could not confirm the 
suicide bombers' identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed 
by Palestinian security officials and also reported by Palestinian 
media. One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, 
and the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya, 
outside the town of Jenin. Both families held so-called mourning houses 
on Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still 
have their bodies. ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said 
Mohammed Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 
22. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.'' The family 
of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been married for three 
months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when she was visiting 
her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the family said. At 
the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the 
site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no lives other 
than those of the assailants were lost. A ring of young men wearing 
skullcaps joined hands and danced, and rabbis spoke of the ``miracle'' 
that had saved those shopping in the market at the time of the attack. 
Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous 
phone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides now have agreed 
that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out.
