Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday 
that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the 
Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism. 
Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord 
would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled 
all of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic 
militants. The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian 
National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian 
National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction. The Israeli 
Cabinet had convened for a second day in an attempt to approve the 
Wye agreement. ``To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement ... there 
has been relentless terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens,'' 
according to a Cabinet statement read on the radio. Israel radio quoted 
officials saying the Cabinet would also decide to renew construction 
of the Har Homa neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of Jerusalem. 
Groundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiations 
with the Palestinians.
