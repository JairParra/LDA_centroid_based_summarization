Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification 
of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The decision 
came less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew 
up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem. Two people were killed 
and 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant 
group Hamas claimed responsibility. The Cabinet said it would not 
resume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian 
Authority has taken steps against terrorism. The Cabinet also said 
it would not resume the ratification process until Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat has clarified the procedure for revoking clauses in 
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The procedure 
is part of the Wye River agreement negotiated last month. However, 
Israelis and Palestinians have widely divergent interpretations of 
how the clauses should be rescinded. Israel says it should be done 
by a vote by the Palestine National Council. The Palestinians say 
a vote is not required.
