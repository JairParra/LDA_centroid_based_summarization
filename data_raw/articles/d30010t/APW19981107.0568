The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for 
the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more 
attacks to try to block the new peace accord. ``This heroic operation 
is not the first and not going to be the last,'' the group said in 
a leaflet faxed to news organizations. ``We refuse any political agreement 
that would recognize the Zionist enemy.'' The leaflet could not immediately 
be authenticated, but its style was consistent with that of past communications 
from the group. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of 
Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah 
claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the 
Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security sources and the 
families of the dead bombers had already identified them as Islamic 
Jihad activists. At least half a dozen other Islamic activists have 
been rounded up since the bombing, the sources said. Although Hamas 
initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone calls to 
the police, all sides now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that 
carried it out. There was no immediate explanation for the inaccurate 
claim, but the two groups have carried out attacks together in the 
past as part of their goal of stopping the peace process.
