Blood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets from the charred wreckage. 
A burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever was 
at hand _ a sodden piece of cardboard, a plastic shopping bag. Two 
people were killed and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged 
car blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, only meters 
(yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 months ago. At police 
barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldiers 
and police held back crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones 
who had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the 
start of the Jewish Sabbath. ``Please, please, is there a girl with 
red hair who is hurt?'' an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying 
to push her way past police. A young female soldier patted her arm 
consolingly. Some of the onlookers gave vent to fury over the new 
peace agreement, which was being debated by Israel's Cabinet even 
as the blast occurred. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!'' a small 
crowd of demonstrators shouted. Police tried to grab one of them, 
but he escaped into the crowd. The explosives-rigged car was a mass 
of twisted metal, with only the steering column intact. Next to the 
wreckage lay a completely charred body with stumps of arms and legs 
_ apparently that of the bomber. Witnesses said they heard a series 
of explosions. Although shop windows closest to the car were shattered, 
market stalls only a few more feet (yards) away were completely intact, 
and stacked with neat piles of bananas and onions. Eyewitness Yaakov 
Shlomo said initial, smaller blasts scared most onlookers away. ``When 
the big explosion went, there were already not that many people nearby,'' 
he said. ``That was a miracle from heaven.'' Shlomo Meir, a black-clad 
Orthodox Jew, was standing nearby when he heard a blast. When he tuirned 
he saw fire. ``It was terrible,'' he said, red-eyed. ``I thought, 
`Again!''' Only a block away, some stalls were still open and shoppers 
were buying produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination, 
sorted through a pile of oranges. ``We can't stop what we're doing 
when this happens,'' she said grimly. By the police barricades, wearing 
bright-orange vests, stood a group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who 
search scenes of accidents and attacks for body parts, in keeping 
with their religious belief that bodies must be buried intact. One 
young volunteer squinted down the street as his group waited for permission 
to begin its grisly task. ``It's hard, this work, but it's very important 
to us,'' he said.
