Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish 
former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday 
in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning 
over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. With his appointment, 
Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West 
Bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions 
that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference 
in the Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, who is currently 
the minister of national infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying 
Israeli troops from more than an additional 9 percent of the West 
Bank would be a ``national disaster.'' In assuming the role of foreign 
minister, however, he would be forced to abandon his public opposition 
to Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the 
Palestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord. Sharon 
will be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu has appointed 
him to direct the final status talks with the Palestinians, which 
would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. Last week 
Sharon told an Israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would 
never shake the hand of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom 
he has long disdained. Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were 
divided in their reactions, in similar ways. Some professed to be 
aghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation 
minister, said they were willing to ``forget history'' if Sharon's 
appointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal. 
In Washington, White House and State Department officials pledged 
to work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an 
Israeli government are an internal affair. ``Arik Sharon is the most 
fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign 
minister,'' Netanyahu said, using his nickname. ``He brings with him 
rich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that 
he well knows both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits 
of peace. ``Sharon has never hidden his beliefs,'' he continued, ``and 
his words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried 
out if not its extent.'' In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu has decided 
on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent 
of the West Bank land. It was supposed to be in the Judean desert 
near Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose a strategic 
security risk. Instead, it was decided on Thursday that the nature 
reserve would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills, much closer 
to existing Jewish settlements. Many Israeli political observers believe 
that Netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this 
appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace 
agreement. ``Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign 
ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians?'' asked Uzi Benziman, 
an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a 
critical biography of Sharon. ``It will be just the settlers and some 
real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public 
opinion. So it's really quite an intelligent move, suggesting that 
Netanyahu means business in trying to get an agreement.'' But the 
Palestinians took the news hard, and read it differently. ``I think 
it's a clear-cut message from Bibi,'' Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator 
for the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. ``I imagine 
people will try to explain Netanyahu's intentions as trying to get 
the support of the right. What he is trying to do is make peace with 
the right wing at the expense of making peace with us. It means he 
wants to continue on the path of non-negotiations, because he wants 
to continue to be prime minister at any cost.'' Sharon declined to 
be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved 
by the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that is expected. An aide, 
Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the position so that he could ``stem 
the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the 
risks facing Israel.'' A retired general who fought in every Israeli 
war, Sharon, 70, is a leading figure of the Likud Party who has done 
much battle with the Likud prime minister. At the most recent party 
convention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from 
his left, which the prime minister dismissed Friday as a comment made 
``in the height of political arguments.'' And when Netanyahu first 
formed his Cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give Sharon a 
senior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in 
ceremony. Sharon retreated to his family farm in the Negev, and David 
Levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve 
unless Sharon was given a post. Netanyahu then created a Cabinet job, 
the minister of infrastructures, especially for Sharon. Levy resigned 
in January after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister, 
and since then Netanyahu has been serving as his own foreign minister. 
Sharon, a member of the old guard, has a complicated political past, 
highlighted by a string of military victories, and checkered, to many, 
by his indirect role, as defense minister, in the Lebanese Christian 
Phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the Sabra and Shatila 
refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. Many Israelis, even those who despise 
his politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who knows his 
mind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power. Friday 
afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally 
applauded the appointment. Uzi Landau, who is a Likud hard-liner, 
said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks. 
``I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon is directly 
involved,'' said Landau, who heads the Parliament's security and foreign 
affairs committee. ``Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation 
for the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon is identified 
with the program, so therefore they can live with it.'' Right before 
the announcement was made, leaders of the National Religious Party, 
who had threatened to bring down the government, changed their combative 
tone. They emerged mollified from meetings with Netanyahu late Thursday, 
saying they would leave the government intact. Still, they would not 
connect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon. ``Appointing 
Sharon is a political step we like very much,'' said Shaul Yahalom, 
the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious 
Party. ``But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement. 
Our concern there is on whether any of the 160 Jewish settlements 
are endangered.'' The appointment of Sharon comes against a backdrop 
of violence that has erupted this week. Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli 
soldier, Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man as 
she got off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the 
Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy 
note from Arafat, who condemned the attack. Also Friday, in the continuing 
clashes between Palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city 
of Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullets 
after the funeral of a Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday. 
After Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter 
introduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had diminished the 
political threat from the right wing by appointing Sharon. ``Are you 
willing to sign on that?'' Netanyahu said. ``I do not know that. I 
do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or 
two people you can never know what will be.'' He was referring to 
his razor-thin majority in parliament _ which some analysts perceive 
to be his key motivator in appointing Sharon. ``More than anything 
else, this reflects the political weakness of Netanyahu,'' said Yaron 
Ezrahi, a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister. ``He 
has recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't 
want to be seen as contributing to the wave of political violence 
that would follow a failure. But he doesn't have the domestic political 
power to carry out the big decision on his own.''
