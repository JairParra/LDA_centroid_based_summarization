Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves 
as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official 
Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner 
in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. 
Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. 
An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly 
responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by 
Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. ``Sharon's appointment 
as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which 
has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for 
the Syrian government. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than 
two years ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached 
an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government 
rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed. Netanyahu 
has sent ``a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves 
_ and betting on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand _ to give 
up their illusions,'' the paper said.
