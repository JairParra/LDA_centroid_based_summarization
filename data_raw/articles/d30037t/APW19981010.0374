Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves 
as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official 
Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced 
the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace. Many Arabs know Sharon 
for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal 
looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the 
massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by pro-Israeli Christian 
Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner 
in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. 
The appointment ``is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which 
has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin newspaper, which often speaks 
for the Syrian government. It said Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message 
to all those who are deluding themselves'' into thinking that Israel 
will change its anti-peace stand. Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke 
off more than two years ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government 
had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's 
government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed. 
Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have been suspended for more 
than two years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The 
independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik 
Hariri as saying: Sharon's appointment makes Lebanon and most world 
states ask: ``Does the Israeli government really want peace as it 
is trying to delude the world?'' An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, 
said in a front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) 
will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.'' ``The 
man is a hero of Arab defeats; he is the firmest believer in the expansion 
of the land of Israel and in resolving the Palestinian problem at 
the expense of Jordan. He is a liar,'' Baasiri wrote. The conservative 
Ad-Diyar newspaper said in a front-page comment: ``The history of 
Ariel Sharon is known. He has called for burning Beirut, annexing 
the Golan, occupying the (West) Bank and slaughtering and displacing 
the Arabs everywhere.''
