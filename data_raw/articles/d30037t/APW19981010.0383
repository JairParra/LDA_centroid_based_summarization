Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves 
as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official 
Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced 
the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace. Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting 
the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with 
the Palestinians. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 
1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion 
found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian 
refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. ``Sharon's 
appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) 
process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often 
speaks for the Syrian government. Peace talks between Syria and Israel 
broke off more than two years ago. Syria and the previous Israeli 
government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. 
But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was 
never formalized. Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message to all those 
who are deluding themselves _ and betting on Israel (to) change its 
anti-peace stand _ to give up their illusions,'' the paper said. Lebanon's 
peace talks with Israel also have been suspended for more than two 
years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent 
An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri as 
asking, ``Does the Israeli government really want peace as it is trying 
to delude the world?'' In a front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said 
``The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with 
Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.''
