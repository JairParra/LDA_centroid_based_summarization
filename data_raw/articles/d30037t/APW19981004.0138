Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next 
foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he 
gets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat. Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, 
is being considered for the government's No. 2 post. In it, he would 
be a pivotal figure in reaching a final peace settlement with the 
Palestinians. ``Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run 
the negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand,'' Sharon was 
quoted as saying in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment. 
Netanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister since the post 
was vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's 
hardline negotiating strategy with the Palestinians. Sharon's appointment 
would signal a toughening of Israel's positions and could further 
strain relations with Arab neighbors. Sharon is the general who led 
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and a former housing minister who 
strengthened Jewish settlement in territories Israel captured from 
Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told the Haaretz 
newspaper he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed 
to ``act to strengthen the country.''
