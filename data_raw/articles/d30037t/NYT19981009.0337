Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer. But for 
more than three decades his role in Israeli public life has been that 
of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in 
the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics. With his blunt 
tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 is 
to his many critics here a caricature of right-wing intransigence. 
To his equally numerous admirers he is a living symbol of unrelenting 
dedication to Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical 
vigor within an impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious 
to a fault. Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign 
minister is not a natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative 
as a teen-ager and an infantry commander wounded in the 1948 war of 
independence, Sharon has fought, and fought memorably, in virtually 
every major military engagement in his country's history. He commanded 
the legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of 
the Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned to active service 
after a three-month retirement to lead Israel's badly outgunned armored 
divisions to victory, again in the Sinai, in the war of 1973. As defense 
minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying 
international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on 
Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the 
Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. 
To some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will 
forever be associated with the massacres by Lebanese Christian Phalangists, 
allies of the Israelis, of a reported 460 unarmed Palestinians in 
the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In an official inquiry in Jerusalem 
and in a subsequent libel trial he brought in New York, Sharon was 
seen to have effectively refuted charges that he knew of and condoned 
the Phalangists' attacks beforehand. But the government investigating 
commission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted 
grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry. Since the 1982 
invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation 
of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young 
inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed. To many Israelis, 
however, the Lebanese incursion was ultimately a risk worth taking, 
as it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving its forces 
far from Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hands in Lebanon 
led eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel 
and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon as Foreign 
Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he proved as savvy 
a political operator as he was a military strategist, helping to break 
Labor's hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding 
force within successive fractious Likud coalitions. His investiture 
as foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment 
in 21 years. He previously held the agriculture and defense portfolios 
under Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak 
Shamir's government, and national infrastructure _ essentially, a 
settlements support directorate _ in the administration of Benjamin 
Netanyahu. As a key member of the ``inner cabinet'' in Begin's first 
government, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion 
of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza 
Strip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967, 
a policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal 
domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remains one of the great 
polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life. An acerbic critic of 
the other leading soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, 
Sharon attacked the Oslo peace accords as ``terrible and dangerous'' 
and condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, as a ``war 
criminal.'' He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return 
of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria. A 
secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born 
Israelis, Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new 
Orthodox Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian areas 
of the West Bank, cementing his position as a bridge between the traditional 
secular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud 
coalition.
