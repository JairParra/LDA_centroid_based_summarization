A senior Palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit 
this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative. ``It 
is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday night after 
a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks 
with U.S. officials on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with 
Israel. Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the 
naming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's 
foreign minister. Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen 
as a bid to keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, 
has been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, 
the Palestinian leadership had said the appointment was an internal 
Israeli affair. Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate 
Israeli comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper 
Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, 
due to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored 
plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank. Erekat said the Palestinians 
hope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, 
would mark the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation 
of accords. ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the 
American initiative and stops attempts to change the references of 
the interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat 
said. At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 
13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan, 
which includes security conditions they must fulfill.
