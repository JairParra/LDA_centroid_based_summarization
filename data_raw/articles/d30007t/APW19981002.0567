Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President 
Laurent Kabila to the Internet. ``We have to explain to the world 
audience who we are and what we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest 
Wamba dia Wamba said on Friday. ``Besides, the (Kabila) government 
has been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.'' The 
56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar es Salaam in 
Tanzania said supporters of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in the 
United States have created a web site for the rebellion. The site 
_ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up on the donor-supported 
Prairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois. The rebels are a 
coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army 
and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, 
corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes. After an initial 
lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, 
the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, 
by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. 
Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of territory 
in the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion was 
declared Aug. 2. Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, 
an area of 15 million people. So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate 
with the rebels, accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring 
Rwanda and Uganda. Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet 
is just part of the media campaign. Last week, Wamba dispatched two 
of his top aides to the United States and Europe to lobby for political 
support and raise public awareness about the conflict in Congo. ``World 
leaders, diplomats and are not familiar enough with our cause. They 
still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well, I'm not a Tutsi,'' 
Wamba said. Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a 
former lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in 
Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the Great 
Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with congressmen, 
Wamba said.
