Back in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and was the head 
of a 25,000-strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket 
of this central African nation. A quarter of a century later, the 
56-year-old businessman who also ran hotels and a tourist camp is 
broke; the farmers group is a memory. Inter-tribal rivalry, looting 
soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have 
wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea 
exports in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green 
pastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into 
a war zone. ``Nobody is making money any more. People are surviving 
on a sack of beans. They are tired of insecurity and have little hope 
things will get better,'' said Kasuku, the son of an Italian settler 
and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, 
and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army took up 
arms, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal 
strife. The war has split Africa's third-largest nation between the 
government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political 
settlement is in sight. Goma, a small trading post at the head of 
Lake Kivu in eastern Congo, is no longer the starting point for tourists 
trekking to see mountain gorillas. Today, its decaying buildings, 
empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders, 
soldiers and people displaced by violence. The rebels have promised 
to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment. They 
also say they will pay civil servants _ who haven't seen a paycheck 
in months or years _ and invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms 
and gold and diamond-mining concessions. But the war has also increased 
tribal animosity _ especially toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly 
successful minority in the eastern region. In 1990, the liberating 
effect of early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes 
and led to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus _ who had 
settled in eastern Congo since the 1930s. Mai-Mai warriors _ armed 
youths from the Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis of stealing 
their land, also joined the fighting. In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan 
refugees engulfed Goma, a town of 30,000. Among them were former Hutu 
soldiers and militiamen who took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring 
Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed. They 
brought anti-Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapons to Congolese 
tribes, who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi landowners and 
ranchers. ``People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy,'' 
said Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. ``We tried to mediate 
between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, but how can you talk to 
people who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads?'' 
In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee 
camps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees 
back home across the border. After an eight-month rebellion backed 
by Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997, 
and Kabila took power. He quickly changed the name of the country 
to Congo, from Zaire. Few people in northeastern Congo expected another 
rebellion so soon. ``I blame our politicians. Then I blame the foreign 
powers who kept meddling in our affairs. It is they who supported 
Mobutu and Kabila, and we are paying the interest,'' Kasuku said.
