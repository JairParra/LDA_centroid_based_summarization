A day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people, rebels clashed 
with government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo 
on Sunday. Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African 
nation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held 
buildings and the airfield, two miles (three kilometers) away. On 
Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu 
airport. Rescue workers said there were no survivors from the downed 
plane, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday. Rebels said 
the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition. In the capital, 
Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, 
said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. It was 
not possible to confirm either claim independently. Rebel commander 
Fino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of 
his Congolese Democratic Coalition had prevented the government from 
landing aircraft at the airport. Kabangu Kalunga said 3,500 rebel 
troops and their Rwandan allies had closed in on government forces 
from three directions after a week of fighting. He said government 
troops did not launch a counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some 
reportedly retreated on the one road leading out of town. The rebels 
say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government has 
used as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions 
in the east. Rebels, who began their insurgency more than two months 
ago, accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry 
out promised democratic reforms, and stirring up hatred among Congo's 
400 tribes. Early in the conflict, rebels pushed far into the west, 
to the outskirts of Congo's capital. Then Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia 
intervened to help Kabila and drove the rebels back to their bases 
in eastern Congo. The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. 
There are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan 
are involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda 
_ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month 
rebellion _ of sponsoring the rebels. Both countries say they have 
legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of 
failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
