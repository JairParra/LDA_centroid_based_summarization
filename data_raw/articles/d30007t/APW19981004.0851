After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered 
Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the 
government to halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, 
said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, 
large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel 
stronghold. ``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said. 
He offered no details and the report could not be confirmed independently. 
Rebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where 
the rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance. The rebels _ 
ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's 
army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila 
of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 
tribes. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they 
were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, 
after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid. Troops 
moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, 
and moving west, had made steady gains against Kindu, which the government 
apparently used to build up force for a planned counter-offensive. 
Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers 
(75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo 
that links Sudan and the Central African Republic. Also on Sunday, 
Ngangura said the rebels took Bumba, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest 
of Kisangani. These reports could not be confirmed independently either. 
Rebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, 
boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them. The 
rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila. But the president has 
so far refused, accusing the rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and 
Uganda, which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the rebellion. The 
conflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo's nine neighbors, 
and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to stop it.
