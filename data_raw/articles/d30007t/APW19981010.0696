Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger 
jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing 
a rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were 
civilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 
miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed 
independently. Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's 
management committee, said a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing 
jet after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport. A rebel military 
commander, who requested anonymity, said the plane was carrying troops, 
although he did not explain how he knew this. He said the plane was 
shot down while approaching Kindu air base, where the rebels had deployed 
at least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500 troops in 
preparation for a final assault on the government-held town. Alexis 
Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel stronghold 
at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters 
had intercepted government radio messages in Kindu and knew in advance 
of the arrival of the aircraft. He said the government had been using 
the Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several 
days. Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs
