Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important 
government-held air base in eastern Congo _ a battle that could determine 
the future of the two-month Congolese war. After trekking several 
hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands 
of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, 
where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base 
as a launching pad for offensives. If the rebels succeed in capturing 
Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, 
this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and 
pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest. A 
rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of ethnic 
Tutsis, disenchanted members of the Congolese army and opposition 
politicians on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila's efforts 
to fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2. Rebel commander Richard 
Mondo said troops had fired artillery rounds into Kindu Monday and 
early Tuesday, sending the population fleeing out of town. Advance 
units had crossed the Lualaba River from the north and were meeting 
stiff resistance in the town, he said. Since the assault on the town 
began at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), at least 18 enemy soldiers were killed 
and 40 taken prisoner, Mondo said, adding the number was expected 
to rise. The rebels took casualties, too, but the number was not known. 
One rebel soldier was wounded in the stomach, he said. He said the 
large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside town, was deserted 
and no one appeared to be in control. ``Our soldiers are in the town 
and the fighting is continuing,'' rebel battalion commander Arthur 
Mulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu. 
There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. On Sunday, 
a spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already under rebel control. 
In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the Congolese 
army was firmly in control of Kindu. Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion 
walked 240 kilometers (150 miles) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake 
Kivu to Kalima, which fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance. 
The rebel fighters, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark green uniforms, 
rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket-propelled 
grenade launchers, said they were advancing slowly through the lush 
forest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall grass. ``We've been resting 
a lot. It took us two weeks to get here,'' Mondo said. The rebels 
are now using Kalima, a town with one main street, scattered houses 
and mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with rice, cooking oil, drinking 
water and ammunition. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) 
away from Kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels' Russian-built 
Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft. The rebels have targeted Kindu since 
late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of 
Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. 
Rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo, including 
Kisangani, the country's third-largest city.
