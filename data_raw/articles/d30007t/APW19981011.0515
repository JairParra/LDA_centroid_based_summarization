A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan 
allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines, showing the 
confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base. 
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila 
River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery 
into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers 
(two miles) away. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government 
forces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed 
to respond to Sunday's attacks. Some troops reportedly retreated through 
a single road corridor leading out of the town. On Saturday, the rebels 
said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to 
land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. In Kinshasa, 
the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the 
victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. It was not possible 
to confirm independently either claim. Kalunga said the airport, although 
still under government control, was in effect unoperational because 
of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby. War-weary, physically 
exhausted and sweaty, hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers 
marched through dense tropical forest went to reinforce their comrades 
at Kindu. After a week of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters had made 
little progress and failed to capture the town outright. The rebels 
see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against President 
Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and 
warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes. Kabila has turned Kindu into 
a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in 
eastern Congo. The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. 
There are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan 
are involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda 
_ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month 
rebellion _ of sponsoring the new fighting. Both countries say they 
have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila 
of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. 
Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting 
Kabila. The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive 
in the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-August. 
The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised 
to overrun the rest of the town. Under a scorching sun, the column 
of rebel reinforcements heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned 
roadside hamlets. The silence of their march was interrupted only 
by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging 
around the soldiers' necks. Soldiers walked by empty huts made of 
mud and palm leaves. Some rested in the shade of the umbrella-shaped 
acacia trees. The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over 
the chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards the path to Kindu. 
There was no immediate comment on the latest developments from the 
government in Kinshasa, which claimed earlier in the week it was in 
control of the tarmac bridge.
