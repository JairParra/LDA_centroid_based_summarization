The bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base 
Wednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic 
air base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese 
President Laurent Kabila. It was impossible to say who had the upper 
hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces 
have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble 
ground troops. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground 
attacks, which began Monday, continued on Wednesday. Mondo said he 
was expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive. 
On Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at Kalima, 
a small town 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu, serving 
as a rear base for the attack. Sweaty and weary, some limping and 
others bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma, 
the rebel stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) east, on the Rwandan 
border. The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers 
in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ faced stiff resistance. 
In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese 
Armed Forces, known as the FAC, had killed 18 rebels in warding off 
the attacks. ``Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which 
has now launched an offensive after defending its positions,'' said 
a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television. ``The civilians 
there are cooperating fully with the FAC as their counterparts did 
previously in Kinshasa,'' the capital. Rebel leaders hope the capture 
of Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two-month 
rebellion into the rest of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The 
rebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai 
provinces, rich in copper and diamonds. The rebels targeted Kindu 
since late August, when they were forced to retreat their march from 
extreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and 
Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. Rebel commanders say their 
2,000 fighters face an estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently 
reinforced by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo. 
The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that 
brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating 
divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.
