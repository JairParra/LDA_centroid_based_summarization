A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast 
faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder 
and leader. Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's 
international airport Thursday. Turkey has asked for his extradition 
and Ocalan has asked for political asylum. Some believe that without 
Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray. ``If the 
head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,'' said Cengiz 
Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. 
But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month, 
and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him. 
``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end 
of the PKK. The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster 
for too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily 
News. Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles 
within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was beginning 
to waver. Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers 
Party, PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, 
mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also 
carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. Close to 
37,000 people died in the conflict. His presence in Europe could also 
be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform 
itself from a rebel army into a political movement. Ocalan seemed 
to be moving in this direction before his detention. While living 
in Damacus, he increased his meetings with European deputies. This 
may be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claims it has made 
important battlefield gains and captured the PKK's second-in-command 
this year. The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, 
which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened 
to attack it. Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border 
with Iraq have also grown lukewarm. The PKK has used their bases in 
Syria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations. ``The PKK had two 
options. Either they choose to fight until they get control of the 
area, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to 
take on a political image. I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the 
Middle East so he could become a political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, 
managing director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. 
In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected 
Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause. They 
also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving. 
There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if 
the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more 
pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights. 
There are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are not 
recognized as an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in 
education or broadcasting. Kurdish politicians have been jailed and 
groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK.
