Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the 
possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla 
leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan 
Workers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in 
southeastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest 
was announced Friday. ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' 
said parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition 
of civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by 
that tradition.'' Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's 
arrest, which was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government 
officials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. ``We 
have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant 
violation of human rights in southeast Turkey,'' government spokesman 
Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday. In the past, Greece has accused 
Ankara of waging a campaign of ``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. 
Ankara counters that Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both 
sides angrily deny the charges. Thousands of Kurdish refugees from 
northern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece. A group of 
more than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square 
Saturday in support of Ocalan. Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, 
Turkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related 
charges, which could carry the death penalty. ``Italy knows what the 
fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the 
Turkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek 
daily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy 
as head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to 
remain in a democratic country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.'' 
Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called 
on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan 
there. The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies 
from the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of 
109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for 
Ocalan to visit Greece.
