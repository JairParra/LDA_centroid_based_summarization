Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a 
second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held 
hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, 
a prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage 
Sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, 
to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, 
Turkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome. 
Calascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention 
in August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. He is 
wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing. 
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his 
hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan 
who is Turkey's most wanted man. ``He is not in any life threatening 
danger. We are not alarmed for his safety,'' said prosecutor Celil 
Demircioglu. ``The negotiations are continuing, we believe he will 
be freed very soon.'' Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition 
would now be delayed by a few days. He denied Turkish press reports 
that the Italian was being held at gun point. Oz is currently on trial 
on drugs-related charges. The mob has often supported right-wing parties 
and ultranationalist causes. At a time when the state is under pressure 
to crack down on the mob, it seemed convenient for Oz to show he was 
backing the government's cause.
