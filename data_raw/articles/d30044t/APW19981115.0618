Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured 
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting 
him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' Kurds in 
Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes 
in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader. Kurds came to 
Rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong 
protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held 
under tight security. If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll 
be tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter 
among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And 
very possibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the 
Rome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where 
he had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He leads 
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting 
for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict 
has killed nearly 37,000 people. To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's 
most-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their arms 
(to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' 
Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy 
continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening 
its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling 
of brawls that broke out during the first day of protests Saturday 
outside the Rome military hospital. The protest in Rome was peaceful 
Sunday. Elsewhere in Europe, dozens of Kurds protested in Bucharest 
until chased away by police; 1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving 
pictures of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents 
outside Parliament and declared a hunger strike. In Turkey, four Kurdish 
prison inmates were in critical condition after setting themselves 
on fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association 
said. Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened 
opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there have been no 
executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to 
extradite anyone if there were even a risk of capital punishment. 
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting 
of European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would tell Italian 
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a serious and fair 
approach.'' He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who 
reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. ``To 
announce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even 
begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told reporters 
before departing. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated 
to reporters in Rome that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's 
billions of dollars of defense contracts if it fails to turn over 
the Kurd. In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that 
the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear 
and responsible manner.'' It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's 
extradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany, he said. 
In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian prisoner 
hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. Metris prison 
officials said the jail director was talking to the inmate captors. 
Ocalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group 
toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor Kurds 
in the underdeveloped southeast. The Turkish army claims to have all 
but wiped out the PKK within Turkey but the rebels have havens in 
Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues.
