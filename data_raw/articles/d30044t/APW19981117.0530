About 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President 
Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place 
during Austria's European Union presidency. Austrian government officials 
reportedly will try to open up a ``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's 
EU membership. A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among 
six countries with whom the European Union started formal membership 
talks on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany 
and France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile 
their differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances. 
They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating process, 
adding ``a political solution is urgently required.'' Austrian police 
took special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. 
``The political situation requires comprehensive security measures,'' 
the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police 
officer, as saying. The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last 
week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers 
Party PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests 
of Turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel, who was accompanied by five 
Cabinet members and a large trade delegation, is the first head of 
state of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. Following 
his talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, 
Demirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and 
other senior officials. He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign 
Policy Society later Tuesday.
