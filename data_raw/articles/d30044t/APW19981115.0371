Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured 
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting 
him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' In Rome, 
1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations outside the 
military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held. Kurds arrived 
from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and 
a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike. 
If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured 
for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the 
singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And very 
possibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport 
on Thursday as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he 
had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria. He 
leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting 
for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict 
has killed nearly 37,000 people. Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist 
and its most-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their 
arms (to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' 
Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy 
continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday it will be opening 
its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling 
of brawls that broke out among the Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on 
Saturday. The protests were peaceful Sunday. Ocalan faces the death 
penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy 
to his extradition. Although there have been no executions in Turkey 
since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if 
there were even a risk of capital punishment. Foreign Minister Ismail 
Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting of European defense 
and foreign ministers. Before leaving, he criticized an Italian Justice 
Ministry official, who reportedly said Turkey's extradition request 
would be refused. ``To announce the results of an extradition trial 
that has not yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' 
Cem told reporters. He said he would tell Italian Foreign Minister 
Lamberto Dini ``that we expect a serious and fair approach.'' Ocalan, 
a political science dropout from Ankara University, founded the Marxist-inspired 
PKK in 1978. He turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding 
wide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast. The 
Turkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within Turkey 
but the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting 
continues.
