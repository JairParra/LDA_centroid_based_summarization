Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops 
and companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian 
authorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Kurdish business leaders 
said the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some 
dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. There are some 4,000 
Kurds living in Romania. Kurdish students cut classes and workers 
didn't go to work. Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to 
protest Ocalan's detention. The protesters have refused any medical 
assistance from Romanian authorities, relying on the services of two 
Kurdish doctors, the paper reported. ``We are not terrorists, as we 
are considered by the Turkish state and its friends,'' said Aihan 
Dogan, a Kurdish leader. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader 
Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey 
has asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey.
