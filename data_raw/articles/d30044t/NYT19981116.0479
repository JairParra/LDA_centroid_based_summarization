Facing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo 
D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader 
who was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey wants Italy 
to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' 
Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He 
is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist. Germany also has a warrant out 
for his arrest on homicide charges. But D'Alema, a former Communist 
who was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from 
leftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news 
conference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. ``The 
last thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like 
this one,'' he said. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition 
of suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Turkey has capital 
punishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being 
tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. 
D'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine 
whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be 
possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, 
holds up. ``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,'' 
D'Alema said. ``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody 
conflict.'' Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government 
met with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial 
meeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration 
and hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision was further 
complicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul 
took an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only 
after Italy extradited Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow 
to pressure.
