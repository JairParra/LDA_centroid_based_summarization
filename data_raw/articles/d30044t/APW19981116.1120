INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at 
least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration 
crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, 
Austrian officials said Monday. Most of those sent back since the 
crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they 
had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, 
about 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. 
They included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as 
Kurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed 
to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking 
to Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey has 
asked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities said many of 
those turned back had come from Germany. A Red Cross station was set 
up at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany 
if their residence permits were in order. Those without proper papers 
were detained by Austrian immigration.
