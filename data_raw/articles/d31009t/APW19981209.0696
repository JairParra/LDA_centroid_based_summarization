The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded 
Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the 
Islamic party a share of power. The military, self-appointed guardians 
of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion 
of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament. Premier-designate 
Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together 
a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 
99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. Ecevit already has 
the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head 
of the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she 
would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 
25 over a mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterated her demand for a 
government that would include Virtue. ``We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's 
premiership. We will support him, but only if all parties represented 
in Parliament are included,'' Mrs. Ciller said. It was not clear what 
Ecevit's next move would be. He might try to form a fragile minority 
coalition. He might also admit defeat and return the task of forming 
the government to President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose 
any member of parliament to head the government until elections in 
April.
