President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely 
trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran 
politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political 
leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of 
the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a 
government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. ``It 
is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win 
a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks 
with Demirel. ``We have told the president that we will not hamper 
the appointment of a deputy of Parliament.'' With party leaders unable 
to overcome differences, the new premier-designate would most probably 
be affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other parties to 
follow an independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been 
suggested as a likely candidate. The new appointment would be made 
within days, Yilmaz told reporters. Demirel consulted Turkey's party 
leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves 
in favor of a government led by a lawmaker. Only center-right leader 
Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and 
made clear she was willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament 
is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right 
parties. Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November 
amid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with 
the sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked 
the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government. 
But Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue 
Party from power. Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the 
return of an Islamic-led government. Modern Turkey has had only one 
Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military 
pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular 
traditions. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the 
Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
