ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced 
intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered 
in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster 
secure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party 
whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said 
he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. 
Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure 
the government. The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, 
who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had 
encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans 
from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid. 
Yigit's allegations were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV channels 
which showed a videotape he had made to explain his version of the 
story before his detention Monday evening for questioning about the 
bidding. Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 
600 million. The government suspended the privatization last month 
after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly 
between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that earlier tape, Cakici 
was heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidders. It was 
not clear who made the tape, which got into the hands of an opposition 
deputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement 
in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead 
with the bidding. Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing 
Yigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender. 
Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation 
national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing 
to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year. Milliyet's 
sale to Yigit was canceled after the scandal. Cakici was arrested 
in France in August. Turkey has requested his extradition. Last month 
State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegations he had been in 
close contact with Cakici.
