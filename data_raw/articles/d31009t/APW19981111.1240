Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against 
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the 
privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster. 
Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left 
Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in 
parliament, votes against him. The leader of the Republicans, Deniz 
Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to 
stay on, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy. ``This is a plot 
and it can't be a reason for a resignation,'' Yilmaz said, adding 
that he intended to continue the ``struggle against organized crime.'' 
Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence 
motion. The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, 
said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said 
the party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil 
sent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent.
