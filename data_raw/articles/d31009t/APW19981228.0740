Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular 
parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, 
on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles. 
The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support 
for Yalim Erez. News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number 
of Cabinet seats that reflected its standing as the largest party 
in parliament. ``We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' at this 
point,'' Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that the two 
had discussed Cabinet posts. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying 
to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members 
from several parties, including Virtue. The coalition would run the 
country only until parliamentary elections set for April. Erez took 
over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist 
Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left 
and center-right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded 
the Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talks with various party leaders 
on Monday. He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who 
said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing. 
``As long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime 
is taken into account, we will do our best to help form the new government 
and ensure it gets a vote of confidence,'' Ecevit said after his own 
talks with Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to 
any deal that would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, 
the Welfare Party, out of power last year. Erez is supposed to talk 
Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who leads 
a center-left party. ``I am more and more optimistic after every meeting,'' 
Erez told reporters after meeting with the party leaders. Turkey has 
been trying to form a new government since a coalition government 
led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged 
the sale of a bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier.
