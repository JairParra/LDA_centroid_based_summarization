After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate 
Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate 
to the Turkish president. In a statement reported by the Anatolia 
news agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday 
morning. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet 
over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed 
in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who 
has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with 
the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Refusing any 
alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party 
in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong 
enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. 
Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival 
center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a 
minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party 
from Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have to either ask someone 
else to try to form a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution 
allows him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary 
elections, now scheduled for April. Such a cabinet would not have 
to face a confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose to leave the current 
caretaker government, headed by Yilmaz, in power until the elections.
