A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, 
President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing 
politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form 
a new government. Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times 
in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a 
government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. 
He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the 
date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer 
period. ``It is wrong to see this government as simply an election 
government,'' he said. ``There are problems that will not wait until 
an election.'' Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, 
have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that 
they do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a Parliament 
just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented 
Virtue Party as the largest bloc. The commanders are also hoping to 
exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister 
Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom 
they trust, from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try 
to build a government that includes their center-right parties but 
not them as individuals. In a meeting this week the country's senior 
policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military 
officers have a strong say, set three priorities for the coming months. 
It said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations 
should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish 
nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus. 
Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political 
crisis with Italy that broke out last month when the Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome and then asked for political 
asylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent here for trial, but Italy says 
it cannot extradite him as long as Turkey retains the death penalty. 
Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among the few senior Turkish politicians 
who favors the abolition of capital punishment. Together with Demirel, 
Ecevit is often cited by Turks who complain about the continued dominance 
of a geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and has been in politics 
for most of his adult life. Early in his career Ecevit emerged as 
a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses. Perhaps more than any 
other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate 
where leftist sympathies were often considered subversive. At the 
same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist. 
He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus 
in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus. He is also 
uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism. During his 
terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined 
efforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then 
called the European Economic Community. He considered it an instrument 
of capitalist exploitation. Ecevit has also disturbed the United States 
by flirting with anti-Western ideologies. In the early 1990s, during 
an interval when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and 
wrote a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently 
called for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains 
some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism 
that he developed in the 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which 
Ecevit heads, is a closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully 
screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty 
to Ecevit is suspect. ``During his terms as prime minister in the 
'70s, Ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder,'' said Ilter 
Turan, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. 
``It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective 
he may not be bad choice.'' ``On many issues that Turkish society 
is encountering now, he represents an orientation which does not seem 
to be totally in tune with the times,'' Turan said. ``That would include 
his position on issues like privatization, integrating Turkey more 
fully into the international system, and the devolution of central 
authority. He has failed to grasp where the world is heading. He looks 
at and analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful 
or appropriate.'' Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives 
modestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. 
He speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and 
intellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. He has 
translated the works of T.S. Eliot into Turkish and published several 
volumes of his own poems.
