A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers 
for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional 
and inhumane. Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan 
said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of 
three defendants in custody in Manhattan. The lawyers complained that 
their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours 
a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area 
in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The defendants 
are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a barren room, called 
the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young, wrote in the letter. 
A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with the views in the letter, 
which was made public Tuesday. In agreeing to review the conditions, 
Sand said, ``Certainly it has to be addressed, that is, the condition 
of confinement for all of the defendants.'' The judge made his comments 
in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment 
by a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities believe 
was the mastermind of the embassy attacks. Bin Laden remains at large 
and is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of 
the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country. 
In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that 
two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while 
the third has been allowed to make only one phone call. The lawyers 
added that the defendants cannot have visitors, write letters, or 
receive mail or books. The skirmishing continued in court. ``I cannot 
give my client a dictionary,'' a third lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, who 
represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge. El Hage has been charged 
with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and has been described by 
the government as a former personal secretary to bin Laden. The two 
other defendants in court Tuesday _ Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed 
Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali _ have each been charged with separate counts 
of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in the embassy attacks 
in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7. All three men have pleaded not 
guilty. Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge 
that the government would have a response by Friday, and his comments 
suggested that the government will be prepared to make some modifications 
in the restrictions.
