Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a 
house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled 
the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing 
gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation 
Division could be seen searching the yard of the house that is surrounded 
by a high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian 
police and FBI agents, told reporters Friday there were four regular 
visitors to the house. They all came at night and used a white 1989 
Suzuki Samuri, which is in police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid 
Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally 
charged by a Tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police 
are looking for two other suspects identified Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian 
of Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of 
Hemed told The Associated Press the house in the Bungoni neighborhood 
of Ilala district had been rented by Ahmad Khalfan. The house is south 
of the center of Dar es Salaam and about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) 
southwest of the embassy building. The relative, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity, said in addition to Khalfan, the three other visitors 
to the house were Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He did not furnish second 
names for them, and it was not clear whether Ahmed was the same Egyptian 
charged in the Dar es Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed 
them photographs, but they were not able to identify them because 
it was always dark when they arrived and left. But all were able to 
identify the Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas 
refrigerator truck actually carried the bomb into the embassy compound. 
It has been identified by its chassis, all that remains. There has 
been speculation that two men in the Suzuiki used a remote control 
device to detonate the bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring 
Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy 
in Nairobi. U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection 
with the Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth 
is a fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody 
in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan 
where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad 
Khalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar 
es Salaam. According to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified 
Fahad as being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing.
