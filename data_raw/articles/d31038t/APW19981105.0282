An Islamic militant group on Thursday threatened to retaliate if Saudi 
dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's 
No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' to Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believed 
to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a 
U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are 
accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. 
The State Department also announced a reward of up to dlrs 5 million 
for bin Laden's capture. ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim 
world ... Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, 
a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, 
or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens 
to him, America will be responsible.'' Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers 
are fighting in neighboring Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, 
which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version 
of Islamic law in those areas. Warsi's group is well-armed with everything 
from machine guns to rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed 
in killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles 
as non-Muslims based on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper 
successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based 
organization labeled a terrorist group by the United States, said, 
however, that foreigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.'' 
Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several 
Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on alleged 
bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan. ``What the United States does 
is their business,'' said Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, 
however, that the United States should know bin Laden ``is a good 
Muslim, and all the Muslim world thinks he is a good Muslim.'' The 
Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited. 
However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of 
bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promised to 
prosecute him if the evidence warrants it. Washington blames bin Laden's 
group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured 
an estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing 
Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in 
eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to 
the area was not considered extensive. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan 
evacuated nonessential staff and family members prior to the August 
bombing of Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While some embassy workers 
are back, their dependents and about 30 percent of the staff have 
not been allowed to return. Embassy officials said no fresh security 
warnings followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already 
in place include cement barricades blocking the road leading to the 
U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the 
brick-walled compound. In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 
on the border with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by 
barbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens 
of armed police.
