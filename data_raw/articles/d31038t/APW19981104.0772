German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word 
of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of 
a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday. Police, including 
agents of an elite anti-terrorist unit, checked several suspects during 
raids in an industrial zone and other sites Tuesday, but no arrests 
were made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's 
Office in Karlsruhe. The agency said it had received ``credible information'' 
that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at 
the sites, but none were found. The agency's investigation is continuing, 
Schuebel said. ``For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat 
to the U.S. Embassy,'' she said. The embassy had no comment. Security 
was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi dissident Osama 
Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks. A suspected 
top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany 
pending a U.S. extradition request, raising concern about reprisals 
on German soil. U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train 
and arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged 
bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In September, 
German police stepped up security at the U.S. consulate in Hamburg 
after receiving a tip about a possible threat.
