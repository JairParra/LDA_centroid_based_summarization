Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications 
for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania. A federal prison official said Monday that 
the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows 
prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts 
of violence and terrorism.'' A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's 
office declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats 
of terrorism. But the law allows officials to impose restrictions 
where they believe there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's 
communications ``could result in death or serious bodily injury.'' 
Under the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison officials 
may segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off their correspondence, 
visits, interviews with the news media and use of the telephone. It 
was not clear yesterday which of these restrictions would be applied 
to the two bombing suspects, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud al-'Owhali. The rule does permit communications with their lawyers. 
A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two 
men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country 
being held under the restrictions. The total population of federal 
prisons exceeds 108,000 inmates. Others similarly restricted include 
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric convicted in the conspiracy 
to blow up landmarks in New York, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted 
of masterminding the World Trade Center bombings in 1993. Michael 
A. Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was ``somewhat concerned 
because these are pretrial defendants, after all.'' ``You can't punish 
them in advance of any determination of whether they are guilty or 
innocent,'' he said. Leonard F. Joy, al-'Owhali's lawyer, said his 
initial impression is that some of the restrictions could hinder his 
ability to represent his client.
