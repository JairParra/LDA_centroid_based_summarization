A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238-count indictment 
Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring 
to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with committing 
acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. Government officials immediately 
announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another 
man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's 
chief military commander. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan 
under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement 
that rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutors 
also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included 
similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. That indictment 
was returned before the embassy bombings and was the result of a two-year 
investigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as 
well as reports that he had connections to a circle of Islamic militants 
in Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, 
accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 
to the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with 
governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist 
groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations. 
But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement 
in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for example, specify 
whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders 
to those who carried out the attacks. Nothing in the document indicates 
why the original indictment was kept secret for months, but the secret 
charges were returned about the time that American officials were 
plotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden. Mary 
Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very common 
to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend those who 
are indicted.'' Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's 
operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq 
to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's 
agreeing not to work against that country. No details were given about 
whether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual 
weapons for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda. The government 
said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief groups 
``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al Qaeda. The groups were 
not identified. Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted 
internal investigations of its members and their associates, trying 
to detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those 
who had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the organization.'' 
The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's 
activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, 
who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons 
and explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting 
in running his finances. While the June indictment against bin Laden 
suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his 
dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges 
are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve 
the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago. Ms. White 
said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and carrying out the most 
heinous acts of international terrorism and murder.'' Citing the more 
than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks and the more than 1,000 
wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense, all of the citizens of the 
world are also victims whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly 
acts of international terrorism strike.'' The investigation of bin 
Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant 
director of the FBI in New York, whose agents have fanned out around 
the world to look into the embassy attacks. ``Our investigative strategy 
is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We will identify, locate and prosecute 
all those responsible, right up the line, from those who constructed 
and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it 
done.''
