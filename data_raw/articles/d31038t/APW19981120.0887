The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. ``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ... He is 
a free man.'' The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated.
