The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since 
the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, 
there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State 
Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks 
against the installations. The latest and most disturbing account 
suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department 
received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little 
to strengthen security at the embassy. The pattern of negligence demands 
examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly after 
the bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador 
in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy 
be moved to a safer location. Her advice was rejected. On Friday, 
Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that 
an Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings 
outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November. 
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists 
were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground 
garage _ that it called for more than a temporary increase in security. 
Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the 
embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and 
defeat. The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain 
to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly 
identical to the plan Ahmed described. Since the bombings, the department 
has been quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. 
It would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions 
was any more credible than Ahmed's warning. No one at the State Department 
is happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the 
tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. 
Of course, additional money would have made it possible to harden 
defenses at more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security 
budget. But more decisive leadership in the department could have 
assured preventive steps were taken in East Africa.
