For some teams, ``out of bounds'' at the Asian Games means more than 
just a line on a soccer field or basketball floor. That's because 
the host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night 
life. The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the 
games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder 
drug and ``night life ideas.'' The Indian team's solution is mandatory 
meetings for all athletes before bedtime. The Sri Lankan participants, 
who had to sign a code of conduct before coming to Bangkok, are being 
watched by an army brigadier with a track record of high discipline. 
The Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble. Thailand, 
especially the capital Bangkok, is known worldwide for its titillating 
night life. From taxi drivers to local tourist magazines distributed 
free at hotels, there are messengers aplenty to advertise massage 
parlors and escort services. Minutely detailed photo albums seek to 
arouse sensual fantasies. Estimates of the number of female sex workers 
in Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 
to 2 million. Under Thailand's drug rules, Viagra is not available 
in drug stores, but is sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription 
from a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for 
400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose. But there is a black market in the 
drug that might prove an attraction for some among the more than 15,000 
athletes, officials and media personnel in Bangkok. ``No way,'' said 
Gurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the Indian contingent, when asked 
if there was a risk of lack in discipline. ``I believe no one will 
try anything silly in Bangkok. Even if they try, our watching system 
is watertight and we will know,'' said Mander, a former police officer. 
Indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at 
10 p.m. before bedtime at the Asian Games village. The Pakistanis 
have opted for trust and nationalism. ``Oh, Viagra,'' exclaimed Pakistani 
medical officer Yousef Baig. ``They know all about it and they know 
all about Bangkok. We have told them, don't break our trust and keep 
the good name of Pakistan flying high,'' Dr. Baig said. China has 
taken a similar approach. ``We don't treat them as kids, telling them 
don't do this, don't do that. We just told them to leave a good impression 
of Chinese athletes,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese 
delegation. For the Sri Lankans, ``we have told them that they will 
not be allowed outside the games village until they finish their discipline,'' 
said Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the Sri Lankan army. 
``Even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany them,'' 
Bandaratillaka said. His deputy is a police officer. Host Thailand 
is stressing that sex isn't lurking around every corner. A ``Traditional 
Thai Massage Parlor'' has been opened at the games' village. ``Thai 
traditional massage is considered an art form,'' said Prarop Laovanich, 
secretary of the Asian Games Sub-Committee for Culture and Performance. 
``A skilled masseur can cure ailments and muscular fatigue.'' And 
one must wear baggy white pajamas before a traditional Thai massage.
