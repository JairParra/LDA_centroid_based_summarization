Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers 
scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling 
a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats. 
Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok 
Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge 
the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team. 
The games open Dec. 6. ``We're not sure if this is related to the 
Saudi jewel scandal,'' Bhichai told Thai radio. ``But regardless, 
we should not mix sports with politics.'' In a letter to the Thai 
prime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, 
Saudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan 
and national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling 
out. But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the 
continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious 
jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home. Thai 
police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many were fakes 
_ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members 
of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real jewels have never 
been recovered. Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three 
Saudi diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis 
barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the 
thousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain unsolved. 
Saudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when the 
two cases were solved. Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, 
said it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because 
of Ramadan fasting. ``If there is any other reason behind this, such 
as the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because 
sports should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said. Organizers 
noted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams. Suggestions 
were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia should consider 
punishing last-minute withdrawals. Organizers need to hold new draws 
for both handball and basketball because of the pullout, but said 
the live television coverage schedule will not be affected. The withdrawal 
is expected to cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's 
expenses for organizing programs, accommodation and television schedules. 
They said they would consult with the council, which oversees the 
organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal. 
Officials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted Tuesday 
during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar. The scoreless 
match was suspended without further play after players from both sides 
kicked, punched and body-slammed each other for about 10 minutes. 
Several suffered light injuries. ``As a host, surely the melee will 
have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand,'' said Santiparb 
Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. ``Nobody wanted 
that incident to happen.'' Officials said that forgiveness was a better 
option than punishment and that both sides would be admonished not 
to let a repeat brawl occur.
