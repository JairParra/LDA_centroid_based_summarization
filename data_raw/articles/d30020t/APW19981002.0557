Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press reports 
that a sports complex would not be completed on time, saying preparations 
are well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday. Santiparb Tejavanija, 
deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, 
said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing 
estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the 
Bangkok Post reported. Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company 
that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from 
finishing the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games. Deputy Prime 
Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the organizing committee, expressed 
doubt last month that the complex would be completed on time because 
of the financial problems. Santiparb told the Post the money problems 
had been overcome by shifting 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth 
of credit guarantees from a project that had been scrapped to cover 
the construction cost of the complex. Preparations for the games have 
been plagued by political interference by previous governments, alleged 
corruption and incompetence. The decision to award the contract for 
the sports complex was controversial, with critics calling it an attempt 
to bail out the property developer's failed housing estate. Doubts 
over Thailand's ability to stage the games increased over the past 
year-and-a-half after the country entered its worst economic downturn 
in decades. The body governing the games threatened several times 
to award Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand 
argued that all would be ready by opening day. The Bangkok games are 
expected to attract more than 10,000 athletes from 43 nations.
