Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games 
to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees 
from the 43 nations competing in the December event. Thailand won 
host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations 
led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten 
to move the games to another country. They complained that the Thai 
organizers were behind in constructing facilities and had failed to 
keep them informed. It appeared that Thursday's tour was successful 
in reassuring everyone. ``We have a strong of sense of relief,'' said 
Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic 
Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee. 
``Everything is 99 percent completed.'' In a welcoming speech, Thai 
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai 
organizing committee, told delegation members to cast aside any doubts 
over whether the Dec. 6-20 games will be a success. ``I can hereby 
confirm that regardless of what Thailand has faced, we ... have tried 
to accommodate all requests for the 13th Asian Games,'' said Bhichai. 
Since the Thai organizers began their preparations, they have faced 
many difficulties, most of them resulting from the country's financial 
crisis, he said. But the country was able to pull it through, he added. 
``This is an example of Asia's resiliency. We have financial problems 
in all of Asia but still we are able to prepare commendably,'' said 
Manuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation. ``I am impressed,'' 
said Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's Olympic Committee. ``The 
games will be a success.'' Still, Bangkok's infamous traffic jams 
did not go overlooked. ``My only concern now is the road construction 
leading to the site,'' said Kenji Ono from Japan. Construction workers 
are trying to ensure that the road leading to the stadium, including 
a flyover at a key intersection, will be completed on time for the 
games. The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the 
Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in 
case of any possible emergency, said its director general, Muttaleb. 
``You cannot really anticipate anything,'' he said, as he toured the 
main stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand. ``Any venue can 
have a problem, such as electrical failure.''
