In rites building from low flares symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron 
lighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving 
Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the 
continent's Olympic-style event. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's 
longest-reigning monarch, was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. 
In a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's 
tropical heat, she won the games' first gold medal in a time just 
one minute off the world record. Her medal ceremony immediately preceded 
the official opening festivities for two weeks of competition among 
6,000 athletes from 41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals are at stake 
in 36 sports, including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak 
takraw. But the king not only made the key proclamation and released 
the royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium 
and composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a talented 
jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. Thai 
officials who approached him at the ceremony did so on their knees. 
Others greeting the king included International Olympic Committee 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch. A cascade of fireworks in honor 
of his 71st birthday Saturday and dancers who prostrated themselves 
on the field welcomed the monarch to his seat in the royal box. Then 
came the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with the host 
Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the last minute, 
was represented by only a flag bearer. The Sri Lankan team was led 
by six dancers in bright costumes, who delighted the crowd in the 
60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers. Each team was led by 
a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard. After the parade, five 
of the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers. A 
giant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to a smaller 
cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then was lifted on an elevator 
and sent an explosion of sparks into the games' flame receptacle. 
Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people waited 
to take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of the games' 
elephant mascot, ``Chai-yo.'' One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old 
piping engineer, who paid 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies 
ticket, said, ``Thailand has many problems. Asia also has many problems. 
For two weeks, maybe we can forget about all these problems.'' Several 
thousand people without tickets milled around outside, waving small 
Thai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king. They also could 
watch the ceremony on a large television screen. Security measures 
included bomb-sniffing dogs. For the competing nations _ many sending 
reduced teams to ease the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are 
a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ``It's 
not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a result that is 
close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of China's 
Asian Games delegation. ``The main target is the 2000 Olympics.'' 
Sunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with slightly built 
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at 9:09 a.m. 
(0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a lucky number. 
Bhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty. The three-hour 
ceremonies featured 7,614 performers in lavishly produced acts with 
the theme ``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.'' Performers in ancient Thai 
garb paraded across the field, followed by people-drawn chariots. 
A martial arts display celebrated Asian unity, and hundreds of primary 
school students dressed in colorful outfits introduced the games' 
mascot. Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana 
epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature 
and performing and fine arts. The field became a swirl of giant snakes, 
swans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures. Another performance 
celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show, with four large swan 
floats pulled to the middle of the field, each tethered to a giant 
balloon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. Fireworks 
burst overhead, searchlights played across the stadium and lasers 
split the darkness before the royal anthem concluded the program. 
The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was 70 
million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of donated 
and at-cost labor _ part of Thailand's remedy for overcoming financial 
problems that hit the games. In warming up the audience before the 
ceremonies, a Thai comedian jested: ``If you're Saudi, raise your 
hand.'' Saudi Arabia withdrew from the games at the last minute, throwing 
some of the scheduling into disarray. It cited a national holiday 
and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw the move 
as retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of 
serious crimes against Saudi citizens.
