Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian 
Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official 
said Saturday. Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin 
Fahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at 
least send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The plea to reconsider 
was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic 
Council of Asia. Sheik Ahmad, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, 
is a friend of Prince Faisal. Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday 
that it is withdrawing its 105-member team shocked hosts Thailand, 
who remain skeptical about the official reasons offered. Saudi sports 
authorities said the Games conflicted with national centenary celebrations 
and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But observers point rather to 
Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two, decade-old 
criminal cases involving their nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million 
worth of jewels from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi 
diplomats in Bangkok. The cases are widely believed to involve people 
high up in the power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution. 
Saudi Arabia has in the past said relations would only be normalized 
when the two cases were solved. Thai newspapers reported Saturday 
that attempts to convince Saudi Arabia to participate in the upcoming 
13th Asian Games have failed. Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. 
Chettha Thanajaro told the Bangkok Post he sent a last-minute plea 
to his Saudi counterpart but has received no response. ``I have done 
my best. We have to respect their decision,'' he told the Post. The 
withdrawal has thrown the Games' schedules into disarray.
