Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring 
countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators 
and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police 
officer said Friday. Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a 
four-day crackdown on panhandlers. About 100 of those detained were 
displayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center 
in Bangkok. ``Most come here because of economic hardship,'' said 
Maj. Gen. Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration 
police. ``There are some beggars, however, who are under control of 
gangsters. They could cause trouble for tourists and athletes.'' Other 
groups targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games are foreign 
criminal gangs believed to operate in Bangkok and other major cities 
in Thailand. The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20.
