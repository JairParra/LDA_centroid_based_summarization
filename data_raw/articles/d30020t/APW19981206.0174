A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led 
to a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that 
shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games. India and 
Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 1947. 
A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed 
a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee 
that forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes. Merchant defeated Mohammad 
Saleh 5-4 after order was restored, but the incident not only violated 
the sport's strict etiquette, but showed the distrust between the 
two neighbors that often has spilled over into sports. The referee 
ruled that Merchant's white cue ball had first touched the black before 
hitting the target, red. Merchant protested. With the referee refusing 
to reverse his decision, Merchant sought help from the Indian team. 
Several Indian team members went to the playing arena, and one of 
them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing 
platform. Disgusted spectators viewed it as a breach of snooker etiquette. 
``It does not look nice for grownup men wearing neckties to fight,'' 
said Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan. ``We just watched the 
whole drama,'' he said. Pakistani team officials did not intervene, 
instead staying in their allocated seats. ``It was made very clear 
to everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that 
the Indians have lodged a formal complaint, we have also done so,'' 
Khan said. The Indian complaint, however, has no meaning now as Merchant 
has won. Indian officials were not available for comment. Tournament 
director Surasak Werapong said both complaints were thrown out because 
neither side paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee. The match was one 
of the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut in style, with 
elated officials greeting the opening with muffled clapping, in keeping 
with the sport's etiquette. A total of 19 countries are vying for 
10 gold medals in snooker and billiards. The preliminary elimination 
rounds began Sunday. ``This is the brightest day for us,'' said Manmohanjit 
Singh, the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards 
and Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body. ``This is 
indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more 
popular in Asia, which is coming up fast,'' said Singh, whose family 
migrated to Singapore from India several decades ago. With the addition 
of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sports.
