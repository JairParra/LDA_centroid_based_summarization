Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to 
compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the 
requirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers 
announced Thursday. The three horses originally came from Iran, but 
arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States. 
They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that 
they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary 
Commission for the games. This is the first Asian Games in which competitors 
have been allowed to bring their own horses from abroad. According 
to regulations, all participating horses had to be screened for a 
number of diseases before arriving in Thailand. Siraya said she felt 
sorry for the Iranian team because the problem resulted from ignorance 
of the rules. Iran is the only country that did not pass the requirements. 
``They are the most beautiful horses of all,'' she said. ``I am so 
sorry for the team but cannot allow them to compete because it is 
against the rules and it might affect other horses' good health.'' 
There is only one Thai horse available on standby for the Iranians, 
as Thailand was not prepared for such a problem, Siraya said. ``If 
the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participating 
countries, they still can compete,'' she said. There are 106 horses 
and 12 countries participating in the equestrian events. Most of the 
horses actually come from Europe and the United States. Thailand has 
provided a climate-controlled stable and field cleared of contaminants 
to help the horses become acclimatized to the tropical heat before 
the competition begins Dec. 8. Many of the horses are suffering stress 
from the journey here, but those from Asian countries are adjusting 
faster than those from cold countries, Siraya said.
