For the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiated 
tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. 
The result was chaos. The lawmakers were never able to agree on a 
budget resolution _ the framework into which all the tax and spending 
bills are supposed to fit. This had not happened since congressional 
budget procedures were established in 1974. Then, without the discipline 
of such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pass eight 
of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running. So 
the lawmakers had to stay in session more than a week longer than 
they had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bills together this 
week and announced an agreement. But the only way they could get this 
far was to resort to gimmicks. One was to designate $20 billion as 
``emergency'' expenditures so that programs did not have to be cut 
elsewhere to offset the new spending. This will use up more than one-quarter 
of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. Another 
gimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts 
to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000. This will actually 
raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years _ the period 
covered by budget accounting _ but it will make the picture considerably 
worse in later years. As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the 
bad old days of budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it 
was exponentially more difficult this year. At least in years past, 
there was a common goal. As much as they disagreed on policy and principle, 
they were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit. This year, some 
members of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut. Others 
wanted to pay off the national debt. Others wanted to spend part of 
it on medical research, schools and weapons for the Pentagon. Others 
wanted to spend large sums on highways. Still others wanted to continue 
cutting government spending. And that was just among the Republicans. 
The Democrats had their own ideas about the budget, and President 
Clinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way 
was found to shore up the Social Security system. ``In budget terms,'' 
said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the congressional budget 
office, ``this is like the end of the Cold War.'' There are other 
differences as well in the way things were negotiated with the budget 
in a surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians staked their 
careers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundamental 
question was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and 
less spending. Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increases 
and favored cutting spending on social programs. Democrats wanted 
to raise taxes, especially on the rich, and protect social spending. 
In the end, balances were carefully drawn. But plenty of politicians 
_ President George Bush, to name one _ lost their jobs in the process. 
This year, with Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory, 
the burning issue was how to parcel out the candy. Democrats got more 
money for education and farm assistance. Republicans got more money 
for the military and an extension of popular tax breaks for businesses. 
Some of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will 
go for emergencies, like relief for victims of Hurricane Georges. 
But much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six 
new helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use in drug 
interdiction, was designated emergency spending simply because there 
was no other way to get it into the budget. For the politicians, the 
new way is more fun. It is hard to imagine that anyone will be voted 
out of office because of this year's budget. But that did not make 
it easier to reach an agreement. The other big difference is that 
the principal fights this year were not over money at all. They involved 
delicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global 
warming, immigration and the census. In Congress, there is no consensus 
on these matters. So the only way policy could be set was to wrap 
them into the giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant to debate 
policy than money. But it is probably harder to find a way to split 
the difference. As long as the surplus lasts, the lack of discipline 
that characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue. 
This is distressing to those devoted to controlling government spending. 
``The temptation,'' said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House 
Ways and Means Committee, ``is to grab the loot and spend it.''
