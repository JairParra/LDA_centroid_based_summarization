Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal 
spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for 
the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided 
aid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, 
because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican 
leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement 
on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. 
That is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees 
and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that 
needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more 
than 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved is a dispute over 
whether airlines can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers 
who are allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other 
members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting 
the proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three 
rows of someone with an allergy. Congress gave itself until midnight 
Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton 
to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government 
open. The budget was due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. 
The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near 
to being written. Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including 
Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief 
of staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded 
were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, 
who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost 
everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with 
the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the 
$20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies 
and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. The 
lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives 
nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further 
expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry 
that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly 
revealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. 
The elections are Nov. 3. But several conservatives said that despite 
these problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark 
Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist 
conservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax cuts were your primary 
thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. 
My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and 
far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. 
Every member has a little different focus.'' Souder said he liked 
the extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports 
for farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers 
were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets. 
Several Republicans said that the bill seemed skewed in favor of the 
Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with 
Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach him, and 
Republican leaders feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they 
might have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. 
``Clinton was buying votes,'' said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. ``He 
was sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support him 
in impeachment.'' Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said the leaders 
seemed motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred 
from the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. He also cited 
the president's need to placate the left by adding costly domestic 
programs. ``The combination of the lessons learned three years ago 
and the scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, 
a budget that leans way to the left,'' Tauzin said. Still, he said 
he would probably support the bill. ``It won't be enthusiastically,'' 
he said. ``It won't be holding my nose either. I would have preferred 
to spend more of this money on a tax cut. I think we would have gotten 
a tax cut, but for the scandal. If the president had not been caught 
up with the scandal, he probably would have followed the Dick Morris 
strategy and moved towards the center.'' Gingrich said he recognized 
that some conservatives were wary of the agreement. But he sought 
to reassure them that the package served their interests. He cited 
a $9 billion increase in defense spending. And he noted that the Republicans 
had blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs in the 
District of Columbia, national education testing and U.S. contributions 
to a United Nations program that pays for family planning in China, 
which many in Congress object to because China has a policy of coercing 
abortions and forcing sterilization. Gingrich said the agreement was 
the best that could be achieved ``when you have a conservative Republican 
Congress and a liberal Democratic president.'' Some conservatives 
who had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. 
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of conservatives in the House, 
had denounced the bill earlier as a Great Society type of big-spending 
program. Friday, after a meeting of Republicans, he said, ``Our leadership 
found themselves in a bad situation and did a good job.'' A few remained 
outright hostile to the bill, as much for the hasty way in which it 
was cobbled together as for what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, 
said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens between 
now and Tuesday. I think it's the process that gives the president 
the ability to stonewall until the very end and then hold us for ransom. 
The Republican leadership in the House and Senate did a good job of 
limiting the highway robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the 
spending caps.'' Also angry at the rushed endgame was Rep. Gene Taylor, 
D-Miss., who took to the House floor and said he could not support 
the final bill. ``I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote `no,' '' 
Taylor said. ``We have stayed here this long. We can stay a little 
bit longer. And I am going to encourage my colleagues to continue 
to vote no until we are given adequate time to study the measure that 
is brought before us.''
