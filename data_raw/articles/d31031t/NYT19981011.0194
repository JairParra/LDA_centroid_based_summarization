Top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the 
White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon 
with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their 
midnight Monday deadline for another day or two. Both sides were amiable 
as they emerged from a two-hour session, but they had little to report 
and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared with 
the last three nights, should not be interpreted as a sign of crisis 
or of imminent peace in the budget talks. Sunday's discussions focused 
on education and President Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 
100,000 teachers, but aides said the bargainers did not delve into 
much detail and nothing was resolved. ``I think we made some real 
progress today, but we still have a significant difference in the 
area of education,'' said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff 
and top negotiator, after Sunday's meeting. ``We're going to try to 
plow through that over the next two days.'' Asked how far apart the 
two sides were on education, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican 
majority leader, replied: ``I don't know. We're not together.'' He 
said the two sides had made ``some progress, but not enough.'' The 
talks came during another day of escalated political confrontation 
as congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they 
have three weeks until Election Day, tried to take advantage of the 
static budget situation. Congress has passed only six of the 13 required 
spending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final 
omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major 
issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much 
money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions 
it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for 
items like increased security at U.S. embassies around the world and 
for American farmers. Also to be resolved are a host of issues that 
have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including 
environmental matters, contraception and national student testing. 
Republicans said the president had been disengaged from the process, 
and they were irked at what they said was his swooping in at the 11th 
hour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently successful 
portrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular topic. Democrats 
countered that the Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year, 
and cast the Republicans as extremists for blocking the president's 
plea for more money to hire teachers and modernize schools. In fact, 
Republican bargainers said Saturday night that they would provide 
the money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how the 
money would be used. Armey was one of many who castigated the president 
for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton has 
been steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry 
in the House. The scant number of congressional Republicans who did 
not leave town for the weekend used the House floor to press this 
same message. ``What about the president?'' asked Rep. Tom DeLay of 
Texas, the majority whip. ``Maybe in Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp 
David? Where is the president? I bet the American people don't know 
that he spent 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising, 
traveling and on vacation.'' Republicans said that Clinton had participated 
in 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on 
Monday in New York, supporting the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles 
Schumer, would bring him to 100. Clinton said at the White House that 
he was ``prepared to do whatever it takes'' to reach a resolution 
over the spending bills, and dispatched his aides to Capitol Hill. 
He also said he would postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon 
his departure for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he canceled 
a fund-raising appearance in Florida. But as the high-level budget 
bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, both sides agreed they would 
need to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary 
financing for the government expires for the third time since the 
Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back 
at the Republicans, saying they have held a slack schedule themselves. 
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been in session only 
108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one 
consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearings 
on the president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more than 
225 days. ``They say, `Where is the president?''' Miller said. ``The 
president has been waiting for the budget. This is the first Congress 
since 1974 that has no budget,'' he said, referring to the broad blueprint 
that is supposed to guide spending. ``This is a Congress that can't 
pass seven of its appropriations bills,'' he said, largely because 
of divisive splits among conservative and moderate Republicans.
