House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal 
health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving 
an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights. 
But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached 
to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding 
the Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle the 
spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the 
Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate. 
The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans, 
which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing 
age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country _ birth 
control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. 
Currently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods. 
The House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this 
year. But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval 
and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion 
on the matter. The cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket 
cost of health care for women. And many male members of Congress seemed 
persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost 
all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency 
drug. Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills 
before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, 
the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their 
conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department 
and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed the contraceptive 
measure through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement as the first 
major accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the Republicans 
took control of Congress in 1994. She said the negotiators had agreed 
to include the measure because in an election year they did not want 
to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting 
a measure that had passed both the House and Senate. But many Democrats 
said the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen 
as interfering with the independence of the Federal Election Commission. 
That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven 
federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general 
counsel and staff director. The provision is aimed at getting rid 
of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated 
the campaign finance practices of groups like the Christian Coalition. 
The contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have 
helped stall four spending bills. The three other bills that are stalled 
in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture 
bill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and 
Drug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like 
RU-486, which induce abortions. The foreign operations bill is also 
stalled over whether to finance international family planning programs 
that may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is 
delayed because of a provision that would block access of minors to 
contraception. Addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives, 
Helen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops, said that the bill was bad policy. She said contraception 
had failed to stem the number of abortions, teen-age pregnancies or 
out-of-wedlock births. ``Public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic 
for them,'' she conceded, ``but in terms of social policy, this is 
a failure.''
