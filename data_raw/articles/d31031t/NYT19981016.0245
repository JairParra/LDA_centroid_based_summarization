Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal 
spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for 
the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided 
aid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, 
because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican 
leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement 
on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. 
That is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees 
and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that 
needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more 
than 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved is a dispute over 
whether airlines can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers 
who are allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other 
members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting 
the proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three 
rows of someone with an allergy. Congress gave itself until midnight 
Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton 
to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government 
open. The budget was due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. 
The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near 
to being written. Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including 
Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief 
of staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded 
were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, 
who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost 
everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with 
the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the 
$20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies 
and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. The 
lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives 
nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further 
expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry 
that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly 
revealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. 
The elections are Nov. 3. But several conservatives said that despite 
these problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark 
Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist 
conservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax cuts were your primary 
thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. 
My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and 
far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. 
Every member has a little different focus.'' Souder said he liked 
the extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports 
for farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers 
were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets.
