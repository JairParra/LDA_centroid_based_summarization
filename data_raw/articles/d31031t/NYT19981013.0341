Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, 
congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday 
with their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate 
support for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes 
element of the budget battle. Negotiators met into the night to hash 
out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives. 
These were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides 
as each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the 
Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton has 
propelled to the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do 
not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more 
than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it. The president insists 
the money be spent on hiring 100,000 teachers across the country so 
that the average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans, 
railing against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school districts 
should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or 
computers. The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, 
including whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives 
and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to 
refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on 
moral grounds as well. And they also were split on how to conduct 
the census in the year 2000. This is one of the thorniest issues. 
It is not one that moves voters, but it is vital to both parties because 
it helps determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and 
top negotiator, met for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttling 
in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but giving few clues 
about the nitty gritty details of their talks. They have given themselves 
another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth 
of spending items, but they could easily extend that deadline another 
day or two. They missed the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing 
temporary funding for the federal government through Oct. 9, then 
Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issues, such as 
financing for the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed 
down, but neither side was ready to declare a final deal until all 
the other elements of the budget package are in place. ``We're down 
to splitting infinitives,'' Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican 
majority leader, said of approving funds for the international fund. 
As they worked through several issues, Republican leaders appeared 
to be calculating the differences in their own party that might sour 
a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ more of a concern 
than on the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer differences 
among its Republicans and with the White House.
