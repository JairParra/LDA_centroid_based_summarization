Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, 
congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday 
with their differences over education, the most politically high-stakes 
element of the budget battle. Negotiators ended a late-night session 
without resolving disagreements over not just education, but the census 
and contraceptives. These were among the biggest issues that still 
separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to take 
home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that 
President Clinton has propelled to the forefront and on which Republicans 
do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend 
more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. The president insists 
that the money be spent to hire 100,000 teachers across the country 
so that the average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans, 
railing against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school districts 
should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or 
computers. As the two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief 
of staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from 
the session saying: ``We don't have a deal. We made some good progress. 
The biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teachers.'' He added: ``There 
are still some open issues'' upon which no agreement has been reached, 
but he sounded optimistic about a session scheduled for Wednesday 
morning. ``I think we've got a chance of wrapping up tomorrow,'' he 
said. The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, 
including whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives 
and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to 
refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on 
moral grounds as well. They were also split on how to conduct the 
census in 2000, which is one of the thorniest issues. It is not one 
that moves voters, but it is vital to both parties because it helps 
determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and Bowles met for much of the day in the speaker's office, 
shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but giving 
few clues about the nitty-gritty details of their talks. They have 
given themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up 
about $500 billion worth of spending items, but they could easily 
extend that deadline another day or two. They missed having spending 
bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing 
temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then 
Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issues, like financing 
for the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but 
neither side was ready to declare a final deal until all the other 
elements of the budget package were in place. ``We're down to splitting 
infinitives,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said of approving 
money for the IMF. As they worked through several issues, Republican 
leaders appeared to be calculating the differences in their own party 
that might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ 
more of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer 
differences among its Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative 
Republicans said they were concerned over the emerging shape of the 
final package, particularly elements dealing with family planning 
and emergency spending. They say the president's proposals for emergency 
spending, on such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing 
the year 2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmers, 
will break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The 
administration said such money would come from corresponding cuts 
elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it comes from raiding 
the surplus. If Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, 
they will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And 
Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House positions, 
on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans 
on aid for farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House 
conservatives, said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too 
quickly to the White House. He said that the president appeared to 
be getting his way on some issues but that what he really seemed to 
be winning was the war of public relations. ``The president is getting 
what he wants; he's controlling the situation,'' McIntosh lamented. 
When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears on television, McIntosh 
said, ``it's in reaction to the president.'' Nonetheless, McIntosh 
suggested that he could vote for a final accord. ``Most conservatives 
are holding out for a better deal than we're hearing,'' he said, ``but 
we'll probably give them the vote because we don't see a much better 
alternative happening if it goes down.'' Others were distressed, particularly 
about two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans 
to cover contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning 
organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. 
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final language 
on the health plan measure. As it passed both the House and the Senate, 
it allowed for health plans with religious affiliation to decline 
to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans to be able to 
refuse such coverage on moral grounds as well. The plan covers five 
specific types of contraception. Coburn said he wanted two of those 
_ Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices _ to be eliminated from coverage 
because he said they interfered with fertilization and were therefore 
considered to cause abortions. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., 
who introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly 
objected to Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their 
decisions on what to offer on profits, not morals. The question is 
whether the White House will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage 
in the final package and will oppose the moral exception. If the administration 
allows the moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. 
House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talks are 
taking on the census. This has always loomed as one of the biggest 
issues separating Democrats and Republicans. The results of a census 
help determine the future power of the two political parties. But 
the fact that the two sides are finally talking about it now indicates 
that they are covering the full range of budget matters that need 
to be resolved. The White House has proposed buying time on the matter 
by financing the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for 
five months. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau. White 
House officials said this would put off the nettlesome issue while 
allowing a resolution of the entire spending package, but House Democrats 
worry it would be a prelude to giving in to Republicans down the road. 
Republican leaders like the idea of postponing a decision but say 
that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau. On 
several touchy environmental issues that have prompted repeated veto 
threats from the White House, the two sides appeared to be opting 
for compromise over confrontation, with several disputes resolved. 
But a few particularly difficult issues remained under negotiation. 
A compromise was struck between the White House and Alaskan lawmakers 
on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded 
them on the question of building a road through a wilderness refuge 
to connect two communities in Alaska.
