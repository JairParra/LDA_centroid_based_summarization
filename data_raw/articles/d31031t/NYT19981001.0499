Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone 
in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the 
Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife 
habitat in Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across 
the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian 
Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King 
Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. Without the 
road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King Cove must continue 
to use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risking 
dangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage. 
Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent 
that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory 
birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better 
alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, was a victory for the state's 
congressional delegation. But with President Clinton likely to veto 
the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors 
can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely 
to emerge just before Congress heads home for the Nov. 3 elections. 
Three Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted 
for it. The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will 
veto a big spending bill if it contains an array of anti-environmental 
provisions that are under consideration. Indeed, the White House seems 
to be itching for a partisan fight over environmental priorities. 
But while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to engage 
in that broad fight, they were willing Thursday to cast their lot 
with the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, 
both Republicans. A companion bill in the House, sponsored by Rep. 
Don Young of Alaska, also a Republican, has not come to the floor. 
Even Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalists, 
voted for the road. Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score 
of environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing 
the road, environmental advocates said Thursday. They speculated that 
the senator had changed his position out of deference to the power 
of Stevens, who as chairman of the Appropriations Committee exerts 
tremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bills are in 
their final stages. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly for 
the road after Alaska's senators convinced him of its merits. Stevens 
said in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land was 
off limits to development and that vital health services were being 
denied to his state's residents. ``We can't use it without permission 
from some bureaucrat who is compelled by extreme environmentalists,'' 
he said. ``They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek 
refuge, the smallest wilderness in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it 
can't move its border 60 feet.'' But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called 
the road project a dangerous precedent. ``Building a road through 
a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be 
the first time in the nation we have voted deliberately to authorize 
a road through a wilderness area,'' Bumpers said. ``And once you go 
down that road, nobody knows where it is going to end.''
