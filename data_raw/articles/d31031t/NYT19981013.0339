A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators 
has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the 
White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with 
House Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders. On Monday, 
White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried 
to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for 
six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees 
the Census Bureau. The deal would put off until next March the contentious 
issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to 
supplement traditional methods of counting people. Bowles told the 
group of Democrats that the House Republicans were willing to give 
on a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement 
on the budget, but that they were digging in their heels when it came 
to financing the census for six months. The Democrats met in the office 
of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale for the half-year 
financing is that by next March the Supreme Court is expected to rule 
on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. The Supreme 
Court has already agreed to review two lower court rulings that said 
sampling would violate federal law. Oral arguments on the cases are 
set for November. But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months' 
financing for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed 
sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve 
money for a census that included sampling. ``The general feeling among 
many Democrats was that even if we won the case, there would be a 
lot less leverage in March, especially if it was the only issue left 
to be debated,'' said a House Democratic official who insisted on 
anonymity. Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans, 
while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign. 
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended the meeting Monday, 
said, ``It was, sort of, this is where we are. We've been able to 
accomplish great things, what do you think? We made it very clear 
that unless the census was included, along with some other issues, 
like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable.'' Statistical 
sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that 
are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting 
of African-Americans in cities and blacks and Hispanics in rural areas, 
groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means. 
Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would raise 
the count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas, giving 
the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts 
are drawn following the 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, the Democrats 
reminded administration officials that Clinton had promised that he 
would veto any legislation that restricted the Census Bureau's ability 
to conduct an accurate census. ``I can't think of any way that restricts 
the census more than not to fully fund it,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y. The willingness of House Democrats, including Gephardt, to 
press the president on the issue represents a realization of their 
leverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the coming 
impeachment inquiry. ``Gephardt is a major player now, and the irony 
is we helped make him that,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., 
who supports the use of sampling in the census. The Democrats' position 
also indicates how little trust many have in the White House on this 
issue. The proposal to finance the departments of Commerce, Justice 
and State for six months is similar to one reached last November between 
Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then was that holding 
all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum 
pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling. 
But House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck 
and later grumbled about it. At a meeting of the Democratic caucus 
Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the White 
House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm 
on the census and that she believed him, a participant said. The statement 
was greeted with laughter. ``There is a certain level of suspicion 
because there have been times when we have been cut out,''said the 
House Democratic official. ``But I have to say, there hasn't been 
much evidence of that, this time.''
