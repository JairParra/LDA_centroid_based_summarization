The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign 
hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's 
foreign minister. In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless 
killing of the four hostages.'' Van den Broek said the EU was determined 
to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed. He planned 
to discuss the killings with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, 
who is in Brussels for talks at NATO. The severed heads of the hostages 
_ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found Tuesday. The men, 
who were working to restore phone services in the breakaway Russian 
republic, had been abducted by gunmen in October.
