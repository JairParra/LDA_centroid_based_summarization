Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped 
foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month 
search in the breakaway region in southern Russia. An Associated Press 
reporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 
40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did 
not see any sign of the bodies. The heads were lined up on a piece 
of cloth along a main highway across southern Russia, NTV television 
reported. The heads were identified as those of the four abducted 
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to 
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in 
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found. But Chechen government 
officials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving 
further details. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny 
that the bodies of four men had been recovered. The hostages _ Britons 
Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's 
Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were working for Granger Telecom, 
a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across 
Chechnya. Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors 
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But 
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill their 
captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying. The 
chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday that Chechen 
authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night that went ``tragically 
wrong.'' No other details were available. He said the company had 
``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers and received confirmation 
that the hostages were alive as recently as last week.'' ``Their murder 
is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts go out to the families 
to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We are a small tightly-knit 
company and everyone here is in a state of shock,'' Verth said outside 
company headquarters in Weybridge, south of London, where flags were 
flying at half-mast. Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies 
in Moscow said they were checking on reports the four men had been 
killed, but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London 
said it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found. 
Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading 
the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several 
suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the 
missing men, said he heard the news and was hoping it would not be 
confirmed. ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from 
out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping 
and praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his 
home in England. Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing 
men for the past two months. British officials said they had not received 
any ransom demand for the missing men. Maskhadov said the deaths of 
the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain 
international recognition of its independence. He blamed the rash 
of abductions in Chechnya to unidentified ``outside forces'' and their 
Chechen henchmen. ``I am ready to answer before my people and the 
whole world for what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax 
news agency. Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common 
in Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war 
for independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed. 
Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in the 
North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of foreigners, and 
90 of them released, officials have said.
