A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more 
than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, 
news reports reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional 
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, 
was seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz 
on Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed 
early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry 
and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus. He was flown 
to Moscow and was waiting for a special plane to take him to Geneva, 
Switzerland, NTV television news said. It was unclear where Cochetel 
was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. 
``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president 
of North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke 
to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's 
part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release 
came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were 
found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went 
wrong. Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies. 
Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and 
was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax 
said. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to 
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports 
said. Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy, 
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand. 
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. Their 
heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers (25 miles) 
west of Grozny. Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against 
Russia ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the 
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are 
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive. 
A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released Friday 
after a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996. Only a handful of 
soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity.
