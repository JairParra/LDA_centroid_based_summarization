One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed 
in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British 
spies. The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov 
at a news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about 
it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government 
had it. The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. One, 
Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the British 
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission was 
to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the 
region, he said in Russian. It was not known whether he was speaking 
under duress. The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined 
up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen 
security forces were still searching today for the bodies. The government 
has said it was trying to rescue the men at the time of their deaths, 
which have outraged Britain and Russia. But its possession of the 
tape was likely to increase suspicions of a government link in the 
frequent kidnappings in Chechnya since it won de facto independence 
from Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most hostages have been released unharmed, 
though dozens remain in captivity. Kennedy and his three colleagues 
_ Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of 
New Zealand _ were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom. They were 
reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in Chechnya when they 
were abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. In the tape, 
Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to monitor phone calls. 
Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew 
Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but any reasonable 
analysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.''
