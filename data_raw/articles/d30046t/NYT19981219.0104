The only thing certain now is uncertainty. The smart money shouts 
that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart 
money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would 
be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would 
require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand 
against him. The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal 
to end all this. Maybe so. But the smarter money whispers, ``Remember.'' 
Remember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would never, ever, 
treat impeachment as a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all the 
pundits predicted Democratic losses in the midterm elections, and 
when the opposite happened, they said impeachment was dead. Twice 
wrong. And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down 
a road it has never traveled before. One other president, Andrew Johnson 
of Tennessee, has been tried by the Senate, of course. But that happened 
in a different country _one with only 37 states, with primitive communications, 
with a simple economy based largely on agriculture, with only minimal 
commitments abroad. In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington, 
the inconceivable has become the commonplace. The wholly unanticipated 
announcement Saturday morning by Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that 
he would not serve as speaker and would resign from Congress, following 
his equally unanticipated disclosure on Thursday night of several 
extramarital affairs, only deepened the capital's profound sense of 
insecurity. The deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears 
unstoppable, at least for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming 
resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise. 
``You've set before us an example,'' the leader of House Republican 
majority, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, told Livingston Saturday. ``The 
example is that principle comes before power.'' The Democrats made 
the opposite point, arguing that the Livingston case showed how very 
wrong it was to savage people for personal pecaddillos. One transcendently 
important thing remains the same: Although surrounded by judicial 
trappings and presided over by the chief justice, trials of presidents 
are political processes, with power residing in the hands of elective 
politicians. In addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence, 
they can weigh considerations of party, the nation's future, their 
own individual political well-being and almost anything else they 
care to weigh in reaching a verdict. The longer they took, the more 
numerous the call for resignation would probably be. Even before Saturday's 
epochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest 
New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought the president should 
step down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large 
majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings. What lies 
behind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the fear that Clinton, 
and the country with him, would be incapacitated. No one took Andrew 
Johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote. 
But Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a series 
of comebacks, has already embarked on an effort to show that he can 
do the nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back to respectability 
after leaving the White House when no one thought he could; Clinton 
intends to re-establish his authority while still in office. He has 
one great advantage: Two-thirds of the American public continues to 
voice its approval of his political stewardship, whatever it thinks 
of him as a man. The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced 
leverage, for a deal on censure. Indeed, in as fine a piece of political 
irony as one could ask for, he has already sought to enlist former 
Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican he defeated in 1996, as an emissary 
to the Senate majority. The numbers are not unpromising: with the 
help of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats could end the trial at any 
time and pass a censure resolution that the House would surely take 
up. There are enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers 
to make that a plausible target. But the Republican leader in the 
Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who has made his unwillingness 
to take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, is determined 
to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement. It is clear that Clinton's 
reputation has been stained forever, no matter what the Senate does. 
The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted 
a glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth, not as the 
Moses who pointed the way to the 21st century, but as the second president 
ever to be impeached, if not as the first to be ousted. That harsh 
word, ``impeachment,'' will cling to his name as surely as ``Teapot 
Dome'' clings to Harding's and ``Depression'' to Hoover's. But he 
is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche 
that was shaken loose by the disclosure of Clinton's sexual relationship 
with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' 
public support has shriveled to 40 percent in the new Times/CBS News 
poll, its lowest level in 14 years, and it could go lower once the 
fact of impeachment sinks in. Journalists are seen by many as jackals, 
indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they 
may cause as long as they get the story, and none too concerned about 
accuracy. In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with 
its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference 
to important national and international issues, has fallen into disrepute 
with ordinary Americans. The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term 
decline in political civility. Republicans called Clinton a liar, 
even as he was committing American pilots to the skies over Iraq, 
and Democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching 
or a political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have been the biggest 
victim of all. Party lines on Saturday's rolls calls held as firm 
as leg irons. Almost all of the Republicans who opposed impeachment 
did so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because 
of special political circumstances _ the Democratic majority in Rep. 
Constance Morella's district in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, 
for example, and the gratitude of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for Clinton's 
peacemaking in Ireland. It is hard to see who has emerged from it 
with reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch 
in the face of deception. If some of the threats and dire predictions 
uttered by House Democrats in recent days are to be taken at face 
value, the nation is entering upon an Era of Bad Feelings, the polar 
opposite of a second Era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the 
1820s, that Clinton had hoped to preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, 
compared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, executed for treason 
in 1535 because of his religious beliefs. He quoted More's words as 
an admonition for today: ``What you have hunted me for is not my actions 
but for the thoughts of my heart. It is a long road you have opened. 
God help the statesmen who walk your road.'' But amidst all the loose 
talk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember: 
Things change with startling speed in modern American politics, and 
the institutions of American government have proved extraordinarily 
resilient. President Nixon, it was almost universally agreed in 1974, 
had weakened the American presidency for many decades to come. Nobody 
said that after eight years under Ronald Reagan, and that was only 
15 years later.
