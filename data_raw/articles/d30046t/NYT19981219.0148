It has gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessary. 
You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks, where the guys 
in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate 
it? They may have to do that to Washington. Just eradicate us and 
start from scratch. In a few, short days we have managed to make the 
terms ``surreal,'' ``bizarre,'' ``split-screen America,'' ``shocking,'' 
``runaway train'' and ``politics of personal destruction'' useless 
cliches. We no longer govern here. We just roll around in the gutter 
wondering who's next in this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, 
we had the surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image of Bob Livingston, 
the speaker-elect, stepping down after his marital infidelities were 
revealed. ``We are all pawns on the chessboard,'' Livingston said, 
before asking the president to resign and then resigning himself. 
Livingston's rabid pursuit of the president, even as he hoped to hide 
his own dirty laundry, made him an avatar of hypocrisy in a capital 
rotting with hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed 
his sins to Republicans in hopes of keeping his hold on his post, 
his colleagues gave him a standing ovation. And after he made his 
surprise announcement Saturday, the Republicans gave him another ovation 
and stepped up to deliver encomiums to their lost speaker. ``One's 
self-esteem gets utterly crushed at times like this,'' sighed Henry 
Hyde, another tormenter of the president who also had to admit that 
he had succumbed to temptation. Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator 
who may next-up in the speaker roundelay, was choked up, praising 
the greatness of Livingston for understanding that this was ``a debate 
about relativism versus absolute truth.'' What could be more relative 
than a Republican who has hidden a lot of affairs trying to impeach 
a president for lying about his? Spurred by Larry Flynt's bounty for 
sinnuendo, the city was braced for more craziness. The Ship of Fools 
reached cruising speed on Friday evening, when we had the frightening 
scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they 
were railroading through an impeachment even though the United States 
was at war with Iraq, even though the House chamber was mostly empty, 
even though Republicans were huddled in a glass house on the issue 
of sex and lies, and even though the White House was still pitching 
a tent and planning sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland press party 
on Monday. (The White House was keeping the journalists quarantined 
outside this year, but encouraged them to bring their kids. To soak 
up some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why are the Republicans 
so obsessed, when everyone in his right mind agrees that impeachment 
is an outlandishly over-the-top punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive 
course for the country? Because they genuinely hate the president. 
They think he's a dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child 
of the '60s. They don't think they're going to pay a political price 
for this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be a great time 
to see a lot of combovers, but it's not a great time to see a lot 
of stature. The House debate was not history. It was just a more hideous 
version of ``The McLaughlin Group.'' While Republicans tried to draw 
the distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that 
the president had been lured by the Starr-Jones attorney team into 
testifying on Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry for 
Livingston. But the Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday 
machine on themselves by focusing so single-mindedly on Clinton's 
sex life. The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech 
lynching that they engaged in wacky role reversals. Many Republican 
hawks argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam, claiming 
the timing was suspicious, even though they had hammered him for not 
bombing five weeks ago. In an incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, 
the majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Bush Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed 
in on the attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it.
