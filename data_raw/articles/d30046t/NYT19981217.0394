House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of 
shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday 
night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican 
colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past. 
``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals 
working together with the media who are investigating my personal 
background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable 
against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on 
impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement after appearing 
before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure 
as it surfaced in news reports. After hearing his admissions in a 
closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave him a standing ovation 
of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen. 
``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans, according 
to lawmakers who were present. The debate over the president's fate 
would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions 
between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity 
scandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president 
is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of 
power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offered 
no immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's 
admissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried 
the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair 
rummaging through his sex life. Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual 
counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he 
had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker 
that ``I was running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There 
was a reason for those words.'' ``During my 33-year marriage to my 
wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing 
so nearly cost me my marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his 
brief prepared statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with 
the allegations against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure 
everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff 
and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' The 
disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed 
in ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty 
among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the 
president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be 
impeached and tried by the Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican 
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the impeachment 
charges against the president, previously was cited by a magazine 
for an extra-marital affair in his past. Then, as on Thursday night, 
Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president 
instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's 
principal accusers. But no proof was offered as Republicans left their 
conference, facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised 
to be bare-knuckled in its partisanship. Livingston left the conference 
surrounded by Capitol police, not taking questions from waiting reporters. 
His chief leadership aides immediately rallied in support. ``Some 
who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue 
to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private 
lives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader. In 
its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not disclose 
its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex magazine. 
Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertised an 
offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of 
Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions. ``It breaks your heart because 
we're all subject to human frailties,'' said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., 
as he left the conference. ``This is not a comfortable circumstance 
for anyone,'' he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect 
presented two separate issues. ``We've got a duty to do under the 
Constitution.''
