Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night 
that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday 
morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that 
he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months. 
He urged the president to follow his example and quit, too. But at 
the White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation are derided 
as a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the 
driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation. Livingston 
stood in the well of the House he has served for two decades and called 
on Clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the Senate, 
drawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit 
instead. He then did just that. ``I must set the example that I hope 
President Clinton will follow,'' Livingston announced to a shocked 
and silent chamber in an act that left the Republican Party in total 
chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton. The decision 
also left the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th 
Congress, when Republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majorities 
in history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, 
the majority whip, somberly welcomed the news, suggesting it relieved 
them of an excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, 
DeLay said, ``He understood what this debate was all about _ it's 
about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we 
honor in this country.'' But Democrats said they were aghast, and 
many _ including Clinton _ called on Livingston to reconsider his 
decision. ``Mr. Livingston's resignation was wrong,'' declared Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual 
McCarthyism. Are we going to have a new test if someone wants to run 
for public office _ are you now or have you ever been an adulterer?'' 
He called on the country to distinguish between sins and crimes. White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton was ``disappointed'' 
at the news of Livingston's plans and wished that he would reconsider. 
Lockhart said the president ``firmly believes that the politics of 
personal destruction in this town and this country has to come to 
an end.'' He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: ``The 
president is going to do what's in the best interest of the country. 
It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal 
destruction.'' Livingston's announced resignation was all the more 
stunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the 
president's removal from office. The speaker is second in line to 
the presidency, after the vice president. Newt Gingrich, the outgoing 
speaker, who was driven from the post after Republicans lost five 
seats in the November election, technically remains speaker until 
Jan. 6, when Livingston's election was to be ratified by the new Congress. 
But Gingrich has removed himself from the daily operations of the 
House at this extraordinary session and has begun to dismantle his 
office. Livingston's decision was said to be driven in part by the 
anger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who were 
disillusioned that he had withheld news of his affairs from them. 
They had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election 
in January that would formally make him speaker. He was also concerned 
about the pain caused to his family by further disclosures, some members 
said. They added that, not lost on many in his party, was the example 
he would set for the president by offering to resign his post now. 
DeLay, No. 3 in the House Republican leadership, is expected to fill 
the power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in title, while 
the party regroups to find a new speaker. Many members quickly rallied 
around Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Hastert, one of DeLay's deputy 
whips who is well respected among his colleagues, had been promoted 
as a candidate for majority leader last month, but never mounted a 
campaign. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously held on to his 
majority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely candidate 
for speaker. He is expected to manage the reorganization, which Republican 
leaders have set for Jan. 4. Livingston met privately with his closest 
advisers Friday as the impeachment debate unfolded. Some of his colleagues 
believed he had made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night _ just 
as the House was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment 
_ that he had ``on occasion strayed from my marriage.'' He told Republican 
leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine was going to 
expose his affairs early next year. Some leaders urged him to keep 
quiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleagues 
immediately, despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor. 
At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill, 
reported on its Web site that Livingston was going to admit to the 
affairs and was going to offer to resign. In a closed-door meeting 
with his fellow Republicans, he did admit to the affairs but made 
no offer to step down, receiving three standing ovations instead. 
Thursday night, Livingston stated that he would ``not be intimidated 
by these efforts'' to exploit his past. But Friday he removed himself 
from public action and that night drew his closest advisers into his 
confidence. His aides said Saturday that they had no clue what was 
he was contemplating, and few other members were aware of his plans. 
Asked if he had any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a newly 
elected member of the Republican leadership, said: ``I had no idea.'' 
Asked if there had been internal party pressure on Livingston to resign, 
Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: ``I didn't know about it if there 
was,'' but added, ``There were some members who were critical of it.'' 
As the leaders tried Saturday to hold the party together on and off 
the House floor, most Republicans stuck to their prepared scripts 
on the floor in favor of impeaching the president. But some began 
expressing their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted to 
his own adulterous affair earlier this year, said after Livingston's 
resignation: ``Those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today. 
Something is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that 
is a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.'' 
To much applause, Hyde declared: ``Congress has no business intruding 
into private acts.'' Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made 
this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, 
saying that Clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused 
the legal system and his powers. As Livingston said in his statement 
Thursday: ``These indiscretions were not with employees on my staff 
and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' Democrats 
hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the 
House to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans 
to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., 
said, ``We are now starting to offer up sacrificial lambs to whatever 
terrible disease this is.'' In a stirring speech applauded even by 
some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, 
praised Livingston as a ``worthy, good and honorable man'' and said 
his resignation was a grave mistake. ``It's a terrible capitulation 
to the negative political forces that are consuming our political 
system and our country,'' Gephardt said, adding that the events of 
the last few days showed ``life imitates farce.'' ``We need to stop 
destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality,'' 
he said, urging his colleagues to ``step back from the abyss'' and 
reject resignation, impeachment and ``vicious self-righteousness.''
