The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' 
drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting 
power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow 
in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future 
speaker of the House. Analysts on both sides of the struggle over 
President Clinton's future will point to Livingston's downfall as 
evidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol 
Hill. Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting Livingston as 
a victim of the sexual puritanism he was wielding against Clinton. 
But the one thing that no one should fall for is Livingston's invitation 
to use his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the 
White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, but it should 
not shake the foundations of the somber constitutional process now 
underway. By lying under oath, Clinton made it necessary for the House 
to consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that 
the president should be censured, but not removed from office. Livingston 
allowed GOP partisans to block censure in the House. The result is 
that after Saturday's expected impeachment vote, after Livingston's 
unexpected announcement, the mission of the Senate remains the same. 
It must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional 
process with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming 
Senate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the 
president's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law. These 
require stern punishment but not removal from office. In undertaking 
this work, the Senate must also reassure the American people that 
a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system 
has not melted down. In such distempered times, this is a shining 
opportunity for the Senate. Its members pride themselves on being 
the Republic's fire wall against presidential excess and the popular 
or partisan passions that sometimes seize the House of Representatives. 
No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will 
rise to the defining challenge of his career or whether he will surrender 
to the mean streak he acquired during 16 grumpy years as a minority 
member of the House. We would like to see Lott reach for a starring 
role in history. Lott's growling response to questions about censure 
is not encouraging. He may be right that the Constitution requires 
him to convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevents him 
from speedily guiding the Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, 
a simple majority vote _ 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans 
_ can end the Senate trial at any time, clearing the way for introduction 
of the kind of censure resolution suggested by former Sen. Bob Dole. 
In an intriguing report on NBC, Tim Russert described discussions 
among a bipartisan group of senators about a censure that would involve 
some form of presidential confession, a fine and a joint congressional 
request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton 
in the courts. If Lott refuses to allow a bipartisan search for censure, 
the burden will fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman 
on the Democratic side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through 
cooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fixes 
Clinton in history as a president who lied under oath, but avoids 
the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House impeachment 
vote. The Senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to 
find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who has 
damaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the government.
