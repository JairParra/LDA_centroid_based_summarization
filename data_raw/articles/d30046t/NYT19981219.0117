Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to 
censure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William 
Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate 
to try him, convict him and remove him from office. But even before 
the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's 
resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month 
by his party, startled the House when he announced he would not run 
for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years of service. 
He urged the president to ``heal the wounds that you have created. 
You, sir, may resign your post.'' Angry Democrats booed and shouted, 
``You resign!'' Livingston continued, ``I can only challenge you in 
such fashion if I am willing to heed my own words.'' Apologizing again 
for extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, he said, ``I believe 
I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the 
kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances.'' 
Then he bolted from the House chamber, nearly knocking reporters and 
members down. (The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article 
of impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a federal 
grand jury. The vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST, leaving the 42nd 
president to face trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed 
from office.) Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, 
Joe Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' 
By calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more 
broadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both cases, 
Lockhart said, ``It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics 
of personal destruction.'' Unless Clinton changes course, this would 
be only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history 
of the Republic, and the first since Andrew Johnson was acquitted 
in 1868. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has 
insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. 
But the Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal. Considering 
the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling the two-thirds 
majority required under the Constitution for conviction is most unlikely. 
Sixty-seven votes would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans 
in the Senate, along with 45 Democrats. Four articles of impeachment 
before the House charged Clinton with perjury in lying about his affair 
with Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He was 
also charged with perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, 
obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The Republican argument, 
over and over, was that Clinton had lied in denying having sexual 
relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority 
leader, said, ``A nation of laws cannot be ruled by a person who breaks 
the law.'' Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said: ``There can be 
no justice without the truth. That is just profoundly so, and that 
is why perjury matters.'' Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the 
Democrats' arguments by saying, ``What the president did was wrong, 
both personally and morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy 
and thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined 
by our founding fathers in our Constitution.'' Rep. Charles Schumer, 
New York's senator-elect, said: ``The rule of law requires that the 
punishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote for censure.'' Saturday's 
votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between 
Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face 
of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974. But while that 
case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the 
Watergate complex, this one began with a murky land deal in Arkansas 
in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel 
under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation 
spread to examine Clinton's affair with a White House intern. All 
year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnect 
with public opinion; since the scandal became public in January, polls 
have shown that the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry 
brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a 
CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their 
representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote. 
The conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon resignation 
cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in a different 
America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion 
polls. But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. 
Some guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which 
showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the 
nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star 
witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought the Republicans, 
seeing dismal numbers in polls about their party's standing in the 
United States, would be the first to blink. With a majority in the 
Senate, they have the power to end a trial at any time after the Senate 
receives notice of impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or 
the next day. But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the 
CBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling 
of his job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject 
him to criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignored 
the polls all year, and confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative 
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican 
caucus, said: ``What's popular isn't always right. You say polls are 
against this. Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. 
Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced 
slavery and ridiculed women's rights. ``You say we must draw this 
to a close. I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not 
with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big 
fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America 
can see it. The point is not whether the president can prevail, but 
whether truth can prevail.'' Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee 
recommended the four articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still 
hoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who 
were uncommitted. As the week wore on, almost all of them broke against 
the president. One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, 
said Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September, 
and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I concluded 
that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the proven offenses 
were not impeachable. ``But the president's continued failure to come 
to grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members 
of the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change 
of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally 
opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful 
opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who 
wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position.'' 
He added: ``Yesterday morning, before I visited with the president, 
I concluded that my original position was the correct one, for me. 
I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven, and 
that the proven offenses are not impeachable.'' But Rep. Tom DeLay 
of Texas, who has led the Republican effort to force Clinton from 
office, dismissed his and other arguments as moral relativism. He 
began by praising Livingston: ``There is no greater American in my 
mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he understood what 
this debate was all about. It was about honor and decency and integrity 
and the truth; everything that we honor in this country. It was also 
a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth.'' He continued, ``The 
president's defenders have said that the president is morally reprehensible, 
that he is reckless, that he has violated the trust of the American 
people, lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored 
the office which they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't 
rise to the level of impeachment.'' Rep. Jose Serrano of New York 
said, ``My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and 
they're praying for him right at this very moment. You may have the 
votes today to impeach him, but you don't have the American people. 
And let me tell you something, I grew up in the public housing projects 
of the South Bronx. I can see a bunch of bullies when I see them. 
The bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours, too. Rep. Henry 
Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman who brought the 
charges to the House floor, said the Congress and the American people 
needed to distinguish between private acts of infidelity and public 
acts by public officials. In Clinton's case, he said, the House was 
dealing with ``a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement 
officer.'' He said that the Senate could be ``innovative and creative'' 
in deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound 
by the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment. ``Justice 
is so important to the most humble among us,'' Hyde said. ``Equal 
justice under the law _ that's what we're fighting for.'' Democrats, 
reading from the same Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite 
conclusions, and attacked the fairness of the proceedings that culminated 
Saturday. ``We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,'' 
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``We're lowering the standards of 
impeachment. What the president has done is not a great and dangerous 
offense to the republic.'' Democrats also criticized Republicans for 
impeaching Clinton at the very moment that U.S. troops waged war against 
Iraq. ``Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a 
lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in chief,'' 
said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat. 
The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber. One Republican 
cited the parallels between the charges the House Judiciary Committee 
brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the counts that the same committee 
brought to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday. ``Nixon cheated. 
He cheated the electoral system,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South 
Carolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, 
the full House is voting to impeach Clinton ``because we believe he 
committed crimes that result in cheating our judicial system.'' But 
most of the day's debate was firmly rooted in Clinton's effort to 
conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia 
Republican on the Judiciary Committee who is one of Clinton's fiercest 
critics, held up copies of the U.S. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's 
report on the impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, 
in defending his decision to impeach the president. ``Today, we rely 
on the three pillars of our society: the law itself, evidence and 
the Constitution,'' said Barr. ``There is no joy in upholding the 
law,'' Watts said. ``If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot 
recognize it. How can we tell our children honesty is the best policy 
when we don't demand it as a policy?'' But Democrats assailed the 
very premise on which the Republican majority built its impeachment 
case against Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking 
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, assailed the four articles of 
impeachment, count by count, as unfounded by evidence and failing 
to rise to impeachment. He saved his most savage scorn for the final 
count, abuse of power. ``The majority has simply tried to dress up 
the perjury counts in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers 
said.
