Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public 
role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President 
Clinton. His previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month 
since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating 
in his public career: He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural 
wrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he ended it by telling 
his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during 
his 20-year tenure in Congress. His disclosure followed an investigation 
by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday 
at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication 
had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the 
last 10 years. Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose 
the ``hypocrisy'' of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton 
and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had 
had affairs with members of Congress. He said Friday that this larger 
investigation, to be published perhaps as soon as January, would reveal 
what he described as indiscretions of several other Republicans. He 
said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired 
an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees 
of the FBI and the CIA. He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry 
Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which has done work for the president's 
private lawyers. Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday. He 
spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of 
the House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach 
Clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues 
knelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the 
back. He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, 
avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between 
the House and his regular office across the street. The only word 
out of his aides was that the Navy had awarded contracts worth millions 
of dollars for ships to be built in his Louisiana district at the 
Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats 
made only oblique allusions to human failures. For example, Rep. John 
Lewis, D-Ga., said: ``Let he that has no sin cast the first stone. 
Who, who among us has not sinned?'' But no one said that Livingston's 
disclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence 
their votes on impeachment. Rather, on the House floor and in hallway 
chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either 
Republicans or Democrats wanted to talk about. ``Bob Livingston is 
a first-rate human being,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who has 
worked closely and sparred with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, 
in an interview. ``I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St. James 
a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking 
after our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's. 
None of us have any business even having an opinion on it.'' Even 
conservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure. 
``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated 
your vows with your wife,''' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like 
many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct 
from Clinton's by saying that the president had ``trampled'' on the 
legal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private. Despite 
Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed the Clinton administration 
for smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. ``This 
isn't just happening on its own,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- 
Calif.
