In the end, the will of the people meant nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't 
have been clearer about that. His mind and the minds of his followers 
were closed. Even as the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from 
coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even 
as his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque 
invasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient 
pursuit of the president, even as the country began to contemplate 
the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the 
speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: ``Let us disregard 
the outside influences.'' The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing 
but the echoes of their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that 
continued even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that 
Livingston would quit the House. Dismayed by the partisan stampede, 
Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, warned during the impeachment 
debate on Friday: ``In your effort to uphold the Constitution, you 
are trampling the Constitution.'' David Bonior, the Democratic whip, 
said: ``This is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. At a time when 
events in the world and the challenges at home demand that we stand 
united, censure is the one solution that can bring us together. To 
my colleagues across the aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen 
to the American people.'' But the voices of reason would not be heard. 
Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry 
Hydes, the Bob Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not 
be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They 
could protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter. 
The right was on the march and democracy was on the run. Rep. Thomas 
Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind his Republican 
colleagues that the Constitution ``does not allow you to remove a 
president from office because you can't stand him.'' He was, of course, 
ignored. The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly 
partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance 
of the will of the people. The party's contempt for the voters was 
arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan Simpson, the former 
senator from Wyoming, who said: ``The attention span of Americans 
is which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly 
report on their stock will change.'' If the voters are the dopes that 
Mr. Simpson thinks they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten 
there was an impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., 
was probably closer to the truth when he said, ``I warn my colleagues 
that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds 
you sow today.'' One of the many strange events of the past couple 
of weeks was the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided 
Republicans, the so-called moderates, surrendered their independence 
and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing's lead. All proclaimed 
loudly that they were voting on principle, but in fact it was an exercise 
in mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep. John McHugh of upstate New 
York. McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment. 
But if his decision was based on principle, he had an odd way of expressing 
it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no stomach for 
a Senate conviction or removal of the president from office. Of his 
colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, ``I, for one, would accept, 
even welcome, their mercy.'' In other words, let the Senate do the 
heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud for 
mercy, but he clearly was too frightened of the right-wingers in the 
House to cast a compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer 
conceal that it is a party of extremists, of right-wing absolutists, 
a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of 
most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment 
can still serve as his party's slogan. ``Let us disregard the outside 
influences.'' Let us disregard the people.
