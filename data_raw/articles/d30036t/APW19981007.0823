When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize 
in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters. 
Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world 
ever since. A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, 
when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's 
most prestigious prize for writers. The prize focuses intense media 
attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally 
drowns out a question: Why does the world care so much about the literary 
choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? Does 
the Nobel Prize really recognize the best? When asked that question, 
Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look 
at the list of prizewinners!'' The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. 
On one hand, the Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers 
such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to 
light, such as Wislawa Szymborska. But the prize arguably also has 
honored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been 
more fairly served by obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first 
prize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice was denounced by Sweden's 
leading literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent 
a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not 
choosing him. Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, 
considering the instructions they were given. Nobel's will says the 
prize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.'' 
What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal** is unclear and the Academy's 
choices have reflected the confusion. The Academy has chosen to interpret 
the word to apply to works ranging from the good-hearted charm of 
Szymborska's poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's 
writings. When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk** 
_ he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one. Allen 
was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a forensic 
expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were. The expert 
succeeded _ to a point. He found that the first word Nobel wrote was 
``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist. Despite the inclarity around 
the edges, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choices bolster 
Nobel's core idea that ``literature would be the basis for some kind 
of progress.'' About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: 
the Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret. But observers 
love to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for 
the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). 
Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S. Naipaul, 
China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago 
of Portugal.
