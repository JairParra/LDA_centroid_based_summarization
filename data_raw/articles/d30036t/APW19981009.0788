A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist 
Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, 
it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers. 
``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language 
author to obtain the prestigious award. ``There have been other Portuguse 
authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels'' 
Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked about 
how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt 
airport as he waited for a flight home to Spain's Canary Islands. 
The news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport 
and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public. ``At 
that moment I was over the moon and returning to the book fair the 
only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing was an error,'' 
said Saramago. Dismissing the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday 
of his achievment, Saramago, a known atheist, quipped that he was 
aware that ``the Pope had been among the jury, I wouldn't have won 
the prize.'' ``The Vatican is easily upset'', said Saramago, ``I think 
that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people 
alone''. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive 
on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago 
was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily 
sports papers ample space to the event. The two leading dailies, Publico 
and Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front pages to Saramago. 
Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations Jose 
Saramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the night. 
Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small 
town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued to study 
part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker. ``Nothing in 
my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize'', said 
Saramago. ``I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books 
until I was 18.'' His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do 
Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral 
crisis. For the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 
41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only 
a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist. He 
returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military 
uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have been translated 
into more than 20 languages. Regarding the future, Saramago said the 
book he is currently working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and 
deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave.
