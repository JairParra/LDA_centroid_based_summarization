There's room for a few more names on a 20th century honor roll of 
writers, and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy 
announces the latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and 
why stimulates animated conversation with readers as well as academics, 
critics and the authors themselves. This year's winner _ or, possibly, 
winners _ will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday. 
``The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard of,'' 
said Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary magazine. But 
the Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also shines a light, 
usually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people have read, he 
added. His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's 
convinced Naipaul probably won't win because of his ``dark ... pessimistic'' 
and often scathing portrayals of post-colonial African culture. The 
academy keeps its deliberations secret. Who is considered seriously, 
even who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, by 
the terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed to 
be irrelevant. Two can share the prize, though the last time that 
happened was 1974. Winners are expected to personally receive it: 
awards are not given posthumously. Looking at the process from afar, 
Harold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, 
said the award committee has an unsettling record of selections that 
are ``nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.''' The winners 
list is prestigious, he concedes, but by no means uniformly lustrous. 
``Absolutely not! Outrageously not,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from New York. ``They include all kinds of fifth-raters. ... James 
Joyce never got one, for heaven's sake. Neither did Marcel Proust.'' 
Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of ``Blood 
Meridian''; Philip Roth, author of ``American Pastoral''; and John 
Ashbery, ``the best living poet.'' A review of recent winners may 
foreshadow this year's laureate. Seven of the past 10 were men _ does 
that favor a woman? Two of the past three were poets _ does that favor 
a prose writer? Four of the past 10 wrote in English, and the last 
three laureates are European. In comparison, only three Asian writers 
have ever won. ``Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine,'' said Abe 
Harumasa, editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. 
``The choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by politics,'' 
given the poet's association with China's democracy movement, ``but 
it's clear he's a wonderful poet.'' Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of 
Chinese literature at Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited 
novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin as worthy. The latter is known for 
her portrayals of the struggles of Chinese women. China, which translates 
and publishes the works of many Nobel winners, ``desperately'' wants 
its first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco 
Ayala, 92, winner of this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, 
said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor 
and secretary of the jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin 
candidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old 
Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's 
Jose Saramago, whose works have been translated into more than 20 
languages. For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent Associated 
Press interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once 
again, he might win. ``Let's not get into that,'' he said. ``I just 
write.''
