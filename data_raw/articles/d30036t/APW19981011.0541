Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace 
Prize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not 
been for strict deadline rules for nominations. That prize was shared 
by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem 
Begin for signing the Camp David peace accords. However, the five-member 
Norwegian awards committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering 
the pact, only to be foiled by their own rules. ``The Nobel committee 
wanted to give the prize to all three,'' said Geir Lundestad, the 
current committee's nonvoting secretary, said on Sunday. ``But Carter 
had not been nominated when the deadline ran out.'' Nominations postmarked 
by Feb. 1 are accepted for that year's prize. The committee can add 
it own nominations at its first meeting of the year, usually in early 
March. The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978, 
about five weeks before that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not 
give him the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 
awards citation ``the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy 
Carter.'' Lundestad said the committee, which works in deep secrecy 
in its five or six meetings a year, tried to find a loophole in the 
rules, which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel 
Prizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist whose 
355 inventions included dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endowed 
the prizes, and said the peace prize should be picked by a Norwegian 
committee and the rest by Swedish institutions. Lundestad said the 
committee turned to the Swedish Nobel Foundation for advice on Carter 
because it was a question of principle. Stig Ramel, a Swede who was 
then director of the Nobel Foundation, advised against breaking the 
rules, Lundestad said by telephone. Normally, the committee refuses 
to discuss past candidates in keeping with a strict policy of secrecy 
in which selection details are sealed for 50 years. Lundestad made 
an exception because Ramel revealed the Carter dilemma in his 1994 
memoirs. Carter has repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel prize 
for his consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He is also among 
the 139 candidates for the prize being announced in Oslo on Friday. 
However, early speculation leans more toward someone involved in the 
Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel to mark 
the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or a human 
rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights 
Charter. While the committee wanted to honor Carter and could not, 
with hindsight some regretted the prize for other reasons. Four years 
after Begin won the prize, the Israeli prime minister ordered an invasion 
of southern Lebanon in which thousands of civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, 
who served on the peace prize committee from 1991 to 1994, once said 
that, had the committee waited, Begin probably would not have won.
