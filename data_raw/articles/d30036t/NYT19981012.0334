Three American pharmacologists were awarded the Nobel Prize on Monday 
for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas, 
nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions. Those 
include widening blood vessels, helping to regulate blood pressure, 
initiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation of 
blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system. 
The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 
82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 
57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid 
Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The 
announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of Monday's 
winners at a meeting in 1986 ``elicited an avalanche of research activities 
in many different laboratories around the world,'' said the Nobel 
committee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which makes the 
awards. Its citation said that the research had led to new treatments 
for treating heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Ignarro 
``discovered the principle that led to the use of Viagra as an anti-impotency 
drug,'' said Dr. Sten Orrenius, a professor of toxicology at the Karolinska 
Institute. Nitric oxide starts the process by which blood vessels 
in the penis widen to produce an erection. Nitric oxide, a chemical 
relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, is better known as a 
common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burns, such as in automobile 
exhaust fumes. But scientists now know it is distributed widely in 
the body. The discoveries honored on Monday were made largely during 
the 1980s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric 
oxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans. The 
award committee said that ``this was the first discovery that a gas 
can act as a signal molecule in the organism.'' The discovery was 
startling because ``nitric oxide is totally different from any other 
known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate 
and nitrite within 10 seconds.'' Recipients of the Nobel Prize, including 
some who have lobbied for it for years, often profess surprise on 
learning of their award. This year's winners were refreshingly candid. 
Furchgott said he had planned to sleep late on Monday, a holiday, 
but was awakened at 5:30 at his home in Hewlett, N.Y. He said that 
he knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated him for the 
award, but that he still was ``somewhat surprised'' to receive it. 
``I guess I had some good friends voting,'' Furchgott said. He said 
he could not get back to sleep. Murad said he had ``pondered the odds 
and thought that maybe I could win the prize, if not now maybe in 
a couple of years.'' He described the award as the culmination of 
a career and said that ``when it happens, it's incredible.'' Ignarro 
was traveling in Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, the dean of UCLA, said ``we 
actually anticipated this day for about four years now.'' The three 
1998 winners never worked together, ``but we talked a lot of shop 
talk at meetings,'' Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president 
of the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt. 
Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that ``the discovery of nitric oxide 
and its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular 
medicine.'' Doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that 
in heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of arteries, makes 
less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish 
stores of nitric oxide. Now, drug companies are trying to develop 
more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide's 
role as a signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric 
oxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes 
to the underlying muscle cells in arteries. Then it can shut off muscle 
contractions in the arteries, thus widening them and reducing blood 
pressure. Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some 
people with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have developed 
dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating the amount 
of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. 
Nitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory 
system, or shock, resulting from overwhelming microbial infections. 
Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release 
enormous amounts of nitric oxide. As a result, blood pressure drops. 
Scientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of 
nitric oxide in such infections. White blood cells also play a role 
in attacking cancerous cells. The gas can also induce a type of programmed 
cell death known as apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's 
effects on the immune system to stop the growth of cancers. They are 
also exploring nitric oxide's possible role in regulating body temperature. 
Doctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the lungs 
and intestines to diagnose a number of ailments, including asthma 
and colitis, and are studying its role in menstruation. Nitric oxide 
formed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all directions to activate 
cells in the vicinity and influence many functions, like behavior 
and the mobility of the intestinal tract. Nitric oxide is also being 
studied for its role in smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role is still 
unfolding; scientists have written thousands of scientific papers 
about it in recent years and have started a journal, Nitric Oxide. 
The Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in 1980 ``an ingenious 
experiment'' that showed that a drug, acetylcholine, widened blood 
vessels only if the inner layer, or endothelium, was intact. Furchgott 
concluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce 
a signal molecule that he called EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing 
factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Furchgott's 
findings ``led to a quest to identify the factor,'' the citation said. 
(OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation did not refer to an accident 
in Furchgott's laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries. 
In 1995, in the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott 
wrote that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned experiments 
on arteries from a rabbit, a technician did not follow directions 
correctly. The technician performed one step of the experiment before 
instead of after he was supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier 
phase of the experiment. Furchgott expected that the arteries would 
contract. Instead, they relaxed. It was the first time he had seen 
the drugs under study produce such a reaction, and he used the insight 
to plan additional experiments. Furchgott omitted the technician's 
name in that paper and in another in 1996 in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association. On Monday, he said David Davidson was the technician. 
(OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro for concluding 
in 1986, from ``a brilliant series of analyses'' conducted independently 
of Furchgott, that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott said 
he and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986 
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the papers were not published 
until 1998. Murad was cited for work conducted over the years while 
he worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford 
University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in Illinois. 
Murad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his early 
work on EDRF in 1980. Murad showed that a gas could regulate important 
cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart 
drugs led to the release of nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN 
HERE) In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in 
Cleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who 
also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the 
University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman said in an interview 
that he believed Rall, now retired and living in Charlottesville, 
Va., was the first scientist to have trained two Nobel Prize winners. 
In addition, Rall worked with Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won a 
Nobel Prize. In his early reseach years, Murad worked on a chemical 
known as cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to 
be critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred to 
the early work as ``dumping experiments'' because all they could do 
in the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and 
agents to slices of tissue, cell cultures. It took years to develop 
the more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric 
oxide's many roles in the body. But for many years, most of the scientific 
community was skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric 
oxide to activate an enzyme, Murad said in 1996 when he and Furchgott 
shared the Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM 
ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, 
whose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine. The 
award committee noted an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel 
developed chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refused to take 
the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused 
headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit in the relief of 
chest pain. Nobel died in 1896. The prize that the three scientists 
will share is now worth $938,000.
