Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel 
Prize for Literature on Thursday. His personal delight was seconded 
by a burst of public elation in his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese 
said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged 
the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million 
people bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. 
``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese 
language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through 
an interpreter. Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged 
and iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country 
and he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language 
``more visible and audible.'' ``I'm personally very happy for myself. 
I'm also happy for my country,'' he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair 
in Germany where he was engulfed by well-wishers offering roses. Back 
home, President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause for ``great 
collective satisfaction.'' Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the 
award was ``above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language'' 
which is spoken by 180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also 
in Portugal's five former colonies in Africa. Saramago's controversial 
opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment 
and the general public. Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican 
newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice, 
describing Saramago as an ``old-school communist'' who had a ``substantially 
antireligious vision.'' Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so 
upset by one of Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name 
from Portugal's nominees for the European Literature Prize. At the 
time, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus 
Cristo'' (The Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's 
Roman Catholic religious convictions and divided the country. The 
book describes a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with 
Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion. ``I have 
not come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago, an atheist, 
at the time. He retreated in disgust with his Spanish wife, Pilar 
del Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands. He has 
never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes, and his 
bluntness can sometimes offend. ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't 
gush, I don't go around smiling, hugging people and trying to make 
friends,'' he once said. A gaunt man with wisps of white hair, Saramago 
was born in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. From a poor family, 
he never finished university but continued to study part-time while 
supporting himself as a metalworker. His first novel, published in 
1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of 
peasants in moral crisis. It sold badly but won enough recognition 
to propel him from the welder's shop to a literary magazine. But for 
the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative 
dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry 
books while he worked as a journalist. He returned to fiction only 
after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974. 
Since the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling contemporary 
writers and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages. 
He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy 
``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as ``Baltasar 
and Blimunda.'' It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition 
and explores the war between individuals and organized religion, picking 
up Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against authority. 
He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable settings 
but at the same time tinged with magical elements. The Nobel citation 
praised his work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion 
and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' 
Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper 
and radio commentaries, though his views are always inspired by his 
deep concern for his fellow man. ``Blindness,'' his most recent book 
to be translated into English, is an unsettling allegory about the 
social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society. 
``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of rationality,'' 
he said. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If 
we did, there'd be no starvation in the world.'' In the 1989 ``The 
History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon proofreader mischievously 
inserts the word ``not'' into a text on the 12th century capture of 
the Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering 
the course of European history with a stroke of his pen. Such historical 
and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks. In his 1986 book, ``The 
Stone Raft,'' the Iberian Peninsula snaps off from the rest of the 
European continent and floats off into the North Atlantic _ apparently 
in a metaphorical search for identity away from the standardizing 
nature of the European Union, of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic 
members. Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize on Dec. 10 in 
Stockholm.
