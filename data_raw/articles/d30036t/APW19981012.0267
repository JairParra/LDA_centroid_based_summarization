Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize 
for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the 
cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from 
hardening of the arteries to impotence. The prestigious prize went 
to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott 
is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, 
Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at 
the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation by 
the Karolinska Institute said ``it was a senation that the simple, 
common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen 
burns ... could exert important functions in the organism. '' Because 
of the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal 
molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections and 
as a regulator of blood pressure.'' ``Signal transmission by a gas 
that is produced by one cell, penetrates through membranes and regulates 
the function of another cell represents an entirely new principle,'' 
the citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals 
has sparked research on a wide range of new drugs, including those 
that can be used in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis, 
shock and impotence. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 
978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, the prize 
went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San 
Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identified 
as causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known outside 
the medical community, although the list of laureates contains a few 
familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert 
Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, 
they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on 
paper but carry large consequences. Among other well-known names to 
receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize 
in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS 
researchers. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield 
may not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 
is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or 
CAT scan. The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be 
announced this year. Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese 
novelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced 
Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. 
All the announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize 
which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, 
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and 
inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes.
