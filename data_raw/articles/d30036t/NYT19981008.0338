Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature 
relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won 
him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers 
in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature 
Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. A tall, balding man 
whose large, tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity, Saramago 
is the first Portuguese-language writer _ and one of the first card-carrying 
Communists _ to become a Nobel Literature laureate. He is also the 
fourth successive European to win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo 
in 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus 
Heaney in 1995. In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised 
Saramago ``who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion 
and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory 
reality.'' Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American 
``magical realism'' on his work, his novels often use the supernatural, 
allegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex 
questions of faith and existence. Many of his novels are set against 
a backdrop of political or historical events, but it is his unwavering 
concern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive 
voice and independent character. His best-known books, all published 
in the United States, are ``Baltasar and Blimunda,'' ``The Year of 
the Death of Ricardo Reis,'' ``The Stone Raft'' and ``The History 
of the Siege of Lisbon.'' His latest book available in English, ``Blindness,'' 
in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, 
was described as his ``symphonic new novel'' by Andrew Miller in The 
New York Times Book Review on Sunday. ``There is no cynicism and there 
are no conclusions, just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment 
of things as they are, a quality than can only honestly be termed 
as wisdom,'' Miller, himself a novelist, wrote. ``We should be grateful 
when it is handed to us in such generous measures.'' Saramago learned 
of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport, where he was preparing 
to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending 
the Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participated in a round-table 
of Portuguese writers on the topic, ``Why I am still a Communist.'' 
He immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers 
and bouquets of roses. ``I am personally very happy for myself,'' 
he said. ``I am also happy for my country.'' Later he told a news 
conference: ``The Portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this. 
There have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that 
it does not become a museum, but is something that is alive. The writer's 
role is to protect it and work with it.'' The award was also celebrated 
in Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it as ``recognition 
of Portuguese culture,'' while the local Communist leader, Carlos 
Carvalho, saw it as a credit to his own party. ``As a member of our 
party,'' he noted solemnly, ``Saramago makes a great contribution 
to our ideals and to the struggle for social change.'' The laureate's 
fiction, though, is never overtly political. Saramago, whose body 
of work includes poetry, essays, plays and a journal as well as 10 
novels, is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only 
at the age of 60. His novels have since been translated into 30 languages, 
selling particularly well in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. 
While he has not been well known in the United States, his novels 
have always been critically well received there. For all his late 
blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer. Born 
into a family of rural laborers and raised in Lisbon, he was forced 
by poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of 
car mechanic. Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 
25. Later, he found work at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive 
and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him 
from writing. It was only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that 
Saramago felt free to find his voice. A member of the Portuguese Communist 
Party since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario 
de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely 
to seize power in Portugal. But an anti-Communist backlash in November 
1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French 
texts into Portuguese to make ends meet. In the late 1970s, he also 
turned to novels, publishing three in succession in 1977, 1978 and 
1980. But it was in 1982, with ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' (``Memorial 
do Convento'' in Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough. 
``This is a rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same 
time has a historical, a social and an individual perspective,'' the 
Swedish Academy noted Thursday. ``The insight and wealth of imagination 
to which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago's work 
as a whole.'' Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, 
the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar, 
and a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a flying 
machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda. 
This fantastic story takes place against the very real background 
of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands 
of men held in the grip of the Inquisition. When the novel was published 
in the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it as ``brilliant'' 
in The New York Times Book Review. ``Mr. Saramago is constantly present 
as a voice of European skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies,'' Howe 
wrote. ``I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility, 
caustic and shrewd.'' In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of 
Ricardo Reis,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet 
Fernando Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story 
in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following 
the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician. Writing 
in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it ``a rare, old-fashioned 
novel _ at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative.'' Saramago, whose 
sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation 
and conflicting use of tenses, sought a different form of freedom 
in ``The Stone Raft,'' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when 
the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe 
and begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide 
with the Azores. To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar is left behind. 
Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, ``The Gospel According to Jesus 
Christ,'' proved controversial, with God shown as using the innocently 
human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance. 
When a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal's entry for a 1992 
European literary prize, the country's conservative government vetoed 
the choice as blasphemous. It was then that Saramago decided to leave 
his small, crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of 
Lanzarote. ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the 
United States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the 
decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the 
word ``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. 
With this ``lunatic creative act,'' as Edmund White put it in The 
New York Times Book Review, he ``totally derails the national saga'' 
by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th-century 
Lisbon from Moorish occupation. White ended his July 1997 review with 
a prescient remark. ``Word has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel 
Prize,'' he noted. ``No candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition 
than this novelist.'' With the recent publication of ``Blindness'' 
in the United States, only Saramago's latest novel, ``Todos os Nomes,'' 
or ``All the Names'' still awaits translation into English. In the 
tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he has now embarked 
on his journals. The fourth volume of these ``Cadernos de Lanzarote'' 
was just published in Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, 
worth the equivalent of $967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm 
on Dec. 10.
