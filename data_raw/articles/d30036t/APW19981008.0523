Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes 
a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday 
was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize. In its citation, 
the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that 
``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually 
enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' Saramago, 75, wrote 
his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar and Blimunda.'' Perhaps 
his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula 
breaks off from Europe for supernatural reasons and floats off into 
the Atlantic. That device allows him to comment ironically ``about 
the authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major 
players in power politics.'' Saramago's exuberant imagination and 
playfulness have made him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary 
novelists, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages. 
In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into English, 
a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind, and the 
affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale of social 
collapse. In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God 
and the devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus tries to back out of 
his crucifixion. ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own 
resonant style of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes 
tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described 
as radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million 
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize). Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) 
is the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize, and 
the first laureate to write in Portuguese. He had long been seen as 
one of the strongest potential candidates for the prize and the frequent 
media queries about his prospects contrasted with his quiet personality. 
``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, 
hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The Associated Press 
in a recent interview. ``I just write.'' Saramago on Thursday had 
planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _ where he was attending the 
international book fair _ for his home in the Canary Islands. But 
Portuguese state radio said he was taken off the plane before departure 
and driven back to the fair, where a crowd wa waiting for him. The 
literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish 
industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have been awarded 
since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started in 1969. According 
to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is to recognize 
writing that works ``in an ideal direction.'' How to interpret that 
term has been widely debated. The Nobel Prize over the years has been 
given to writers with world-views stretching from the bleak futility 
of Samuel Beckett's works to the vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor 
Laxness. The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not 
work in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand 
Russell. Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright 
whose work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political 
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, 
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous. The Swedish Academy does 
not reveal who was nominated or who it considered on its shortlist. 
Nominations can be made by previous laureates, professors of history 
and literature, members of the Academy and presidents of some national 
authors' organizations. The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be 
announced Oct. 12, the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the 
economics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All 
the prize announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize 
which is given in Oslo, Norway. All the prizes are presented on Dec. 
10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
