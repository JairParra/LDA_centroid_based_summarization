President Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on 
Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening 
ties to South Korea and the United States. The appeal came during 
a meeting with reporters at which he also counseled patience over 
Iraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapons inspectors. ``I 
think it's important that we not overreact here on the first day,'' 
Clinton said in response to reports that Iraq had balked at a request 
by U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program. But, speaking 
at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton 
called the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had 
``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors. Aides 
to Clinton denied that his comments represented any softening toward 
Iraq. They said that because the situation was still developing and 
the president was preparing for meetings with Kim he had not been 
briefed in detail on Iraq's resistance when he appeared before reporters 
Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the administration 
was consulting with other members of the U.N. Security Council about 
the matter. If Iraq fails to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions, 
he said, ``We obviously are prepared to act.'' Last weekend, Clinton 
called off a strike against Iraq minutes before it was to begin, delayed 
his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that U.S. forces 
remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let 
U.N. weapons inspectors do their work. In his appearance with Kim, 
the president addressed a handful of questions that ranged from North 
Korea to Indonesia to whether the Congress should punish him over 
the Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington for this five-day 
trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew a parallel between the governments 
of Iraq and North Korea, saying, ``We must be no less concerned by 
North Korea's weapons activities.'' The Clinton administration is 
urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea 
that it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant. 
Saturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's test 
firing in August of a missile over Japan, ``cause for deep concern.'' 
But the Clinton administration is trying a very different approach 
toward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, 
who is pursuing a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement with the North. 
As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions 
Saturday, Clinton became most animated in describing what he called 
``a very beautiful picture'' that he happened to spot after turning 
on his hotel television on arriving in Seoul on Friday night: film 
of a cruise ship recently permitted to carry South Koreans on a tour 
into the North. ``I ask the North Koreans to think about this,'' he 
said, arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented 
them with a great opportunity. ``Nothing could ever be put in that 
hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, 
as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those 
ships going up there full of people from here.'' The Clinton administration 
fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea 
has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear 
weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. The North 
Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear 
weapons. But they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million 
to inspect it, a request rejected this week by a U.S. delegation to 
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The new complex is being built 
on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former 
North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday to emphasize 
his hopes for a new opening toward North Korea. But he said, ``We 
will not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate 
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.'' 
The Clinton administration plans to resume negotiating with North 
Korea over inspecting the site in December. In addition to strategies 
for easing the Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea 
during a visit to Tokyo on Thursday and Friday. The subject of North 
Korea consumed most of his two hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday 
at the Blue House, which contains the Korean president's office and 
home. The administration has been criticized in Congress and in this 
region for letting its policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton called 
that policy a ``clear-eyed mix'' of diplomacy and deterrence. He said 
that so far the 1994 agreement had worked, because without it ``North 
Korea already would have produced a sizable amount of weapons-grade 
plutonium.'' Under pressure from congressional critics, Clinton last 
week appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review 
his policy on North Korea. On other matters, Clinton declined to criticize 
the government of Indonesia for using force to crack down on protesters 
there, saying that he did not ``have enough facts at this moment to 
give you the right answer.'' But he said he hoped there would be ``no 
backsliding'' in Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance with Kim 
with a visit to the National Folk Museum here, where he conducted 
an hourlong conversation with six Korean academics, businessmen and 
union leaders about the troubled state of Korea's economy and its 
impact on the society. He attended a state dinner Saturday night, 
before stopping by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician, 
happened to be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim for 
his efforts at economic reform, noting that interest rates had fallen 
here and the currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim during 
their private meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates, 
or chaebols, that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. 
In describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring 
the chaebols ``perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the South 
Korean economy.'' Clinton said during the economic forum Saturday 
afternoon that he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act 
on the chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the restructuring, 
he said, ``but they should begin.'' On Sunday, Clinton plans to visit 
some of the 37,000 American troops stationed here.
