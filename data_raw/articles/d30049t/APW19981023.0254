A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be 
producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear 
facilities than already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim 
Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had 
``information'' that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy 
satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He said in a Parliament session 
that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and 
the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting 
around 2004. If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected 
North Korean nuclear activity than already made public. Kim said he 
asked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier 
this week and was suspicious of its answer. ``It was not sufficient 
or sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to 
hide the truth,'' Kim said in a seven-page press release. U.S. and 
South Korean officials said in August they had detected a huge underground 
construction site on a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast 
of Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear complex. The United States 
has said it suspects the construction is nuclear-related, though it 
has no evidence. North Korea has denied it. Kim, a lawmaker from the 
main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two 
underground facilities not far from the Yongbyon complex. It was activity 
at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord 
promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments 
if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At the time, 
North Korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or 
two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt 
laboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord. 
Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and the 
other is under construction and will be operational in four to six 
years. ``We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003, 
enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon 
within six to 12 months,'' Kim said. ``North Korea would be able to 
make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every 
year after that.'' North Korea has said the underground construction 
is for civilian use and not nuclear-related. It has offered to open 
the facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay compensation 
if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use.
