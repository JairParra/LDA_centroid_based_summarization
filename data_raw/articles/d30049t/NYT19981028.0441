North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to 
discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground 
complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, 
the State Department said on Wednesday. The delegation, led by Charles 
Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence 
agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a 
frozen nuclear arms program. ``We've made clear to the North Koreans 
that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development 
program would be unacceptable,'' the State Department spokesman, James 
Rubin, said. The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, ``are 
aimed at completely satisfying U.S. concerns about the suspect construction.'' 
American intelligence agencies fear that building the complex could 
be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea 
pledged to give up its nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billions 
of dollars in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. American 
officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands 
of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, 
the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled 
enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. 
Although they have not explained exactly why the government is building 
the complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used 
to develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency 
said last week that the government was building ``civilian underground 
structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that 
American officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they 
pressed for access. ``If the U.S. side persists in inspecting our 
underground structures,'' the press agency said, ``we can show it 
to them.'' Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurances 
that Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, 
and his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the trip, 
which is to begin on Nov. 16. ``We are beginning a discussion with 
them in which we will demand access,'' Rubin said. ``The history of 
the U.S.-North Korea discussions involves usually a lengthy discussion 
process before there is agreement to our requirements. So we are not 
expecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next.'' 
The trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of relations 
between the United States and North Korea. Representatives of the 
United States, China and the two Koreas met recently in Geneva and 
agreed to steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. In September 
the United States pledged to provide an additional 300,000 tons of 
grain to North Korea, which has for years been crippled by severe 
food shortages. In addition the White House disclosed that the United 
States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under 
the 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to 
revive its nuclear program. American officials have said the activity 
near Yongbyon may not yet have technically violated the accord, because 
there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for 
a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to 
bomb-grade plutonium.
