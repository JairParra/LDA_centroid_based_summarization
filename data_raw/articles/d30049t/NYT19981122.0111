In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday 
visiting American troops stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, 
sang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats 
to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. ``Lately, signs 
of danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an address to airmen 
here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. 
``So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are.'' For all 
his eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like 
quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again during 
his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional 
military threat posed by North Korea. The subject consumed most of 
his meetings with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea on Saturday 
and formed the backdrop for his visits with the troops Sunday. ``It's 
kind of tense around here,'' said John Kelley, a 26-year-old airman 
from Wisconsin, describing life on this base. ``You know you're only 
four minutes away from a missile.'' In his speech, Clinton pointed 
to recent North Korean missile tests, incursions into the south and 
a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation 
as signs of the potential threat. And he compared North Korea to Iraq, 
saying that North Korea was ``also a major concern'' because of its 
chemical and biological weapons. Until North Korea ``fully commits 
itself to a constructive role on this peninsula,'' he said, ``we must 
remain ready.'' Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement 
with North Korea, though, saying that there were ``some hopeful signs'' 
to justify it. He pointed to talks that began over the summer between 
the American military command in Korea and the North Korean military 
to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south 
and north. Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return 
to Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam. On a bright 
but icy afternoon, Clinton was warmly received here by soldiers in 
camouflage and black boots, some of whom waited almost three hours, 
shifting from foot to foot and rubbing their hands. The official crowd 
estimate was only 3,500, but the turnout seemed even smaller. The 
base, about 30 miles south of Seoul, is one of two major American 
airfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others who wanted to see 
the president were bused in from sites that are hours away. Before 
flying here by helicopter, Clinton attended church on an Army base 
in Seoul, then visited a firing range just 12 miles from the demilitarized 
zone. In a brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett of West 
Liberty, Ohio, from private first class to specialist. And he led 
the troops in a round of ``Happy Birthday'' for Sgt. Maj. Charles 
Thomas of Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 on Sunday. ``It definitely caught 
me off guard,'' Thomas said.
