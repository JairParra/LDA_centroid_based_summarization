SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's 
support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear 
site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander 
a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula. President Kim 
Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged to 
``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the 
nuclear question. He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at 
a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop 
missiles. On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held 
a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions 
for putting the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security 
are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. 
Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet 
certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North 
Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing the 
door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site. On 
the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable 
discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting 
the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's 
twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged 
that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the underground 
construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. But he said 
the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. 
inspection of the site. ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton 
said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential 
mansion overlooking the capital. ``We need access to it.'' The foundation 
of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward 
the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which the North halted 
its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to 
build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shattered 
if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. 
Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging 
North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, was firm in saying his 
government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue. In meetings this 
week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed 
in their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence 
officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear 
weapons program. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain 
the nature and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. 
``If it is, in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should 
demand immediate close down.'' He also said the North must limit its 
missile development, citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the 
North Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31. U.S. spy satellite 
photos show thousands of workers digging a massive complex. U.S. special 
envoy Charles Kartman on Friday retracted an assessment he made Thursday 
that there was ``compelling evidence'' that North Korea is building 
an underground nuclear facility. In a statement distributed by the 
U.S. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, ``There is strong information 
that makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the 
intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if 
so, what type of nuclear facility it might be.'' Kim said his government 
would support U.S. efforts to resolve the nuclear question. The North 
Koreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear 
purpose, and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing 
inspections. Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing 
his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new 
tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise 
ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening 
up to its 1950s Korean War enemy. ``Nothing could ever be put into 
that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership here, that 
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as 
much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up there 
full of people from here,'' Clinton said. In his meeting with Korean 
community and business leaders at Seoul's National Folklore Museum, 
Clinton praised South Korea's progress in recovering from its financial 
crisis. On a darker note, he mentioned recent tensions over Asian 
steel exports to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year 
at great cost to the domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is 
the biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports also are on the 
rise. Clinton said the U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports 
_ if they are not concentrated in just a few industries, and if the 
result is that the Asian economies begin to recover. ``We have to 
be sensitive if the price of doing that is to basically erase'' an 
entire sector of the U.S. economy, Clinton said.
