This city has always kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders _ dictators, 
unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it 
thinks can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's 
agenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the 
leftist leaders of Iran and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s 
it was populated by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President 
Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting 
in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador 
Allende Gossens in Chile was to ``make the economy scream.'' Diplomatic 
etiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies 
list from the White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't 
about personalities, right? But last week, driven by frustration, 
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the 
Clinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situations, 
in opposite corners of the world, the United States spoke loudly because 
it can't find a stick. Sunday, hours after he called off an attack 
on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of 
U.S. policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein 
_ what Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' 
No matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably. 
The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used 
his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw 
U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the code 
word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing 
America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprisoned 
his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has suddenly 
become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, 
not by a long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call 
for reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted 
that way. The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The 
Malaysian government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference 
in internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S. companies 
that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians that Gore was 
rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered words that needed 
to be said. Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the 
question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful 
nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome 
leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real 
criteria for getting on it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, 
like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. President Clinton is spending the 
weekend on the Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized 
zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to 
break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, 
in return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never 
called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive 
regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook, 
suggested last week that if the United States really wants to look 
at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a nuclear installation 
in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. No 
one even called for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lobbed 
a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how. ``The rules 
for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky,'' said Richard 
Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego 
who served in the Clinton administration's first term. ``When they 
really want to push someone out, it is because that country is part 
of a larger strategic concern at the time. But the country itself 
usually doesn't have great strategic weight'' _ it's another matter 
to call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it 
helps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point 
to.'' Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely 
a ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler 
of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President 
George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam 
nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem, 
but not a threat to the region at the moment''). Mahathir, however, 
is far more complex case. He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's 
political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move 
a leader from the list of authoritarians whom Washington tolerates 
to the list of authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness. 
Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and 
Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was 
that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also seemed 
eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has never 
been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country into a 
model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar of the 
``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department touted 
until things went sour last year. Sure, he was always prickly. But 
he is no terrorist or killer _ U.S. companies have flocked to his 
country, and say they want to stay _ and his iron control over political 
discourse is no stronger than in neighboring Singapore. Just this 
summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly 
friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference to human rights. 
That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail. He 
has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to economic 
turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest movement against 
Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore leapt on that opportunity 
_ particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier 
this year, it took the administration months to come to the conclusion 
that President Suharto had to go. He went.
