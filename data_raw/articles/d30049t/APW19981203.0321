North Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military 
is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over 
nuclear inspections comes to blows. The North's official Korean Central 
News Agency reported that North Korean soldiers and people of all 
walks of life were ``on full alert for war.'' North Korea typically 
sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake 
talks with Washington. The United States and North Korea are set to 
resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean 
site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts 
brimmed with anti-American saber-rattling. ``Our People's Army will 
blow up the U.S. territory as a whole'' if the United States starts 
a war on the divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong 
Chang Ryol was quoted as saying Thursday. The general staff of the 
North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the 
situation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections 
and talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons 
and long-range missiles. ``Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, 
the Korean People's Army is now bracing itself for a fight against 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors,'' KCNA quoted Jong as saying. The 
agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, even museum 
curators as pledging a ``thousandfold revenge'' or vowing to arm themselves 
with the ``spirit of human bombs and of suicidal attack.'' Washington 
demands unconditional inspections of the North's underground project. 
But North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the right 
to inspect the site. Concerns that North Korea was developing long-range 
missiles capable of striking all of Japan and parts of the United 
States escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed 
to be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan 
and landed in the Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military 
is the world's fifth largest. It forms the backbone of the North Korean 
government, with leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head 
of the military.
