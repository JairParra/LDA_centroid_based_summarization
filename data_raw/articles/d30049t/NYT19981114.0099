A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said 
Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and 
deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved 
to death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, 
who has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo 
on his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken 
of North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open 
sores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back 
a bag of what officials called ``substitute food'' being distributed 
by a government food station: dried leaves and straw, so coarse that 
even cattle would normally turn away. ``They grind it into powder 
and make it into noodles,'' Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition 
and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, 
he said. North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic 
difficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of 
how serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other 
organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit 
better now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might 
have arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did 
seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to 
North Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed 
to visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based 
on visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasized that public health 
care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants were holding 
down a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without 
electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, 
in part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienated 
would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations has repeatedly 
appealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal has 
raised less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without 
Borders announced that it was pulling its staff of 13 from North Korea 
because it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected 
rather than to the most needy. North Korea does not release mortality 
figures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations 
had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent 
of North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and 
that 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. Hall said 
he thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that 
the total was probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the 
seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, 
the U.S. Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting 
that North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and 
has since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline 
of 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population 
would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on 
the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, 
an American specialist on North Korean population figures, says that 
there simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the 
death toll from the famine. But he notes one political tidbit: North 
Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate 
to the country's ``people's assembly'' for every 30,000 citizens. 
This year's assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather 
had just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in 
1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North 
Korea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected 
to add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people 
or fewer. The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea, 
but strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North 
that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons 
program. The United States warned last week that the ``agreed framework'' 
that is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy 
unless the North lets American experts visit the underground complex 
and resolve their doubts. North Korea has said that it will show off 
the complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not 
a nuclear one, it will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.'' 
Washington refuses to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff 
could lead the agreement to fall apart. ``Their shameless and wicked 
demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference 
in our internal affairs,'' declared North Korea's leading newspaper, 
Rodong Sinmun.
