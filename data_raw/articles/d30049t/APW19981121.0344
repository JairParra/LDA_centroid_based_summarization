SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's 
support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear 
site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander 
an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. President 
Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged 
that his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. 
endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full access 
for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said 
the North must constrain its development and exports of missiles. 
On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable 
discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting 
the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's 
twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged 
that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious 
underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. 
But he said the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it 
refuses a U.S. inspection of the site. ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' 
Clinton said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, 
the presidential mansion overlooking the capital. ``We need access 
to it.'' The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long 
hostility toward the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which 
the North halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western 
commitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal 
would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine 
nuclear project. And that, in turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South 
peace talks that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice 
that ended the Korean War in 1953. Kim, who has moved South Korea 
to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging North Korea on cultural and economic 
fronts, firmly said his government supports Clinton on the nuclear 
issue. ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature 
and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. ``If it is, 
in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand immediate 
close down.'' He also said the North must limit its missile development, 
citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the North Koreans test-fired 
a missile its way Aug. 31. In a dinner toast, Kim said that despite 
tensions, ``North Korea is cautiously but noticeably taking measures 
to increase interaction and cooperation between the South and the 
North.'' And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle against Asia's economic 
woes. ``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more prosperous, 
more stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small measure to Korea's 
example.'' After the state dinner, Clinton made a surprise late-night 
stop at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, 
Roger, and his band were performing. The president listened to songs 
off stage before his brother introduced the president as ``a very 
special person.'' The audience of 2,000 people stood and applauded. 
In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. 
officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground 
site, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret 
effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite 
photos show thousands of workers digging a massive complex. U.S. special 
envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday after the Pyongyang talks that 
there was ``compelling evidence'' of an underground nuclear facility. 
But in a statement distributed by the U.S. Embassy here Saturday, 
Kartman backtracked, saying instead that the United States lacks ``conclusive 
evidence'' the site is a nuclear facility. ``There is strong information 
that makes us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the 
intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if 
so, what type of nuclear facility it might be,'' Kartman said, offering 
a ``clarification'' of his earlier remarks. Kim said his government 
would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve 
the nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground 
construction site has any nuclear purpose, and it has demanded a dlrs 
300 million payment for proving that. In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, 
Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing his remarks at 
North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal 
that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement 
touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean 
War enemy. To risk that kind of cooperation _ and progress with America 
on other issues _ by stonewalling on the suspected nuclear site is 
contrary to the North's long-term interests, he said. ``Nothing could 
ever be put into that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership 
here, nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would 
give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, 
as much happiness, as more of those ships going up there full of people 
from here,'' Clinton said. To underscore the U.S. military commitment 
to South Korea, Clinton was scheduled to venture out of the capital 
on Sunday to visit U.S. Army troops at a training range north of Seoul. 
He also planned to address American troops at Osan Air Base from a 
U-2 spy plane hangar.
