North Korea has demanded that the United States pay hundreds of millions 
of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that 
U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, 
Clinton administration officials said Wednesday. The United States 
rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North 
Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government 
delegation. ``As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue 
of compensation, and we flatly rejected it,'' said State Department 
Spokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money the North Koreans had 
demanded, Rubin said payment of the fee was ``so not on as a possibility 
that I don't care to get into the figures.'' Other administration 
officials said the fee would have been hundreds of millions of dollars; 
one put it at $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that the 
complex, which is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast 
of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended 
to be used for a nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly said 
U.S. inspectors could visit the site as long as Washington agreed 
to pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe 
as the administration's slander. The North Korean representative at 
the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United 
States could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed 
not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation 
for slandering and defaming my country.'' U.S. intelligence agencies 
fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to 
abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which 
North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange 
for billions of dollars in aid. The U.S. delegation, led by Charles 
Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean issues, 
left Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three 
days with a team from the North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talks 
ended as Clinton began a trip to Asia that will include a visit to 
South Korea, where the issue of the North Korean construction site 
is expected to be among the major topics discussed with President 
Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed 
for access to the site. ``We told them that access to the site is 
essential,'' he said. ``We've expected that this would be difficult, 
and we told the North Koreans, as we've said before, that verbal assurances, 
as they are wont to give, are simply unacceptable.'' U.S. officials 
have said the construction of the underground site may not yet have 
technically violated the accord, because there is no evidence that 
North Korea has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing 
plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. But if the 
United States determines that North Korea has revived its nuclear 
program, Rubin said, ``it would go against the entire letter and spirit 
of the objectives of the agreement, and it would affect the viability 
of the agreement.'' The administration has expressed growing concern 
over North Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, including 
the underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last 
August of a missile over Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense 
Secretary William Perry to review U.S. policy toward North Korea. 
Administration officials say Perry is being asked to study ways to 
salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had been 
among the administration's proudest achievements in foreign policy.
