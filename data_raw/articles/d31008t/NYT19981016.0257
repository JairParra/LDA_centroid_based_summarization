Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead 
of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his 
funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. 
``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had 
succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that 
was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, 
through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian 
church and across Casper on an AM radio station. ``Judging from the 
world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have made a difference in 
the lives of thousands.'' As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed 
Casper, fresh flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard 
had been baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white 
robes of an Episcopal acolyte. ``There is an image that comes to mind 
when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the 
Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace 
that image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate 
on that man, I can release the bitterness inside.'' Shepard, a 21-year-old 
freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one 
day for human rights. In death, he has become a national catalyst 
for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical 
safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens 
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements 
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. 
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution 
that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and that urged 
each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to denounce this 
outrageous murder of another human being.'' In one of the largest 
rallies, about 1,000 people, including members of Congress of both 
parties, gathered on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn 
Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that would 
add extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, 
gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage 
of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.'' ``We 
will never forget the love that the world has shared with this kind, 
loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside 
Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. He said 
the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the thousands of e-mail 
comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and cards offering help, 
consolation, sympathy and support.'' Before the funeral, about a dozen 
protesters, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual 
messages. But mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' 
and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends 
and family members entering the church. On hearing of the protest, 
Laramie's City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and 
unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests during funerals. 
Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protesters 
were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a Republican, added, 
``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in.'' Shepard was 
born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several 
years of high school and college here. With flags at Casper's public 
schools flying at half-staff Friday, many mourners were his old classmates. 
Others traveled here, one driving from as far away as New Jersey, 
out of a sense of solidarity. ``I've had a pit in my heart and my 
stomach since I heard this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 
miles to wait three hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral 
of a man he never met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and 
his family.'' Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder 
has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters. 
At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will wear 
yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of Shepard. Organizers 
said that yellow signifies tolerance and green symbolizes peace. In 
Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located in the heart of Wyoming's 
oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword. ``Prejudice against 
homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, 
Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in its main editorial on Sunday. 
``Violence against our homosexual friends and neighbors has created 
a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming and the rest of the 
nation.'' Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, 
wrote lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not 
just because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay 
people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place called 
Wyoming.'' ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled 
of the young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying, 
because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile frame.'' 
In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the University 
of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate Oct. 7, attributed 
the chance discovery to ``God's plan.'' On that afternoon, Kreifels, 
an 18-year-old architectural engineering student, had nearly completed 
a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, 
in public lands east of Laramie. Kreifels recalled in an interview 
Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, ``I hit this big limestone 
rock and did one over the handlebars.'' Dusting himself off and looking 
around in the fading light of the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed 
something out of my eye that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around 
the fence, and as I got closer, I noticed the hair.'' Shepard, his 
hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence 
post, was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious. ``Sometimes I 
wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to die,'' Kreifels reflected, 
before traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parents in 
Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God wanted his parents to be with 
him.''
