Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, 
a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital 
bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired 
scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: ``I'm Gay.'' Few people missed 
the message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming 
freshman, was savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a 
position that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, 
officials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the 
fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures 
against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The fraternity chapter immediately 
suspended seven members and said they had acted independently. But 
in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being held on campuses 
across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility 
toward gay people often flourishes in high schools and universities, 
gay leaders said Tuesday. ``People would like to think that what happened 
to Matthew was an exception to the rule but, it was an extreme version 
of what happens in our schools on a daily basis,'' said Kevin Jennings, 
executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, 
a New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the schools. 
Shepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning from 
the injuries suffered in the beating. He never regained consciousness 
after being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hours after he 
was lashed to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron 
McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder 
charges. Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, 
18, have been arraigned as accessories after the fact. In response 
to the killing, about 50 candelight vigils were scheduled this week, 
from Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City. At the 
Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was in intensive 
care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received 
about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences. Tuesday, when funeral 
arrangements were announced for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital 
Web site received 30,000 hits an hour. Friends at the University of 
Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial 
Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate 
crime legislation. ``I see his name going down in gay history as a 
catalyst for renewed activism,'' said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite 
who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization 
in New York. From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed 
that campus homophobia is not restricted to college towns in the Rocky 
Mountain West. Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts 
high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped 
school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 
percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the 
past year. These percentages were about five times greater than the 
percentages of heterosexual respondents. The survey was conducted 
at 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education. In 
a separate study of nearly 500 community college students in the San 
Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondents said they had verbally 
threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened 
or assaulted gay people. The study was conducted this year by Karen 
Franklin, a forensic psychologist who is a researcher at the University 
of Washington. Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late 
1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and 
Penn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened 
with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally 
harassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying 
group based in Washington. Last year, a student group in Des Moines, 
Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations 
at five high schools on 10 ``homophobia recording day.'' They estimated 
that the average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay 
remarks every day. ``Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed 
out gays,'' Foreman said. ``There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism 
and anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes, 
to express anti-gay sentiments.'' In a survey of the nation's 42 largest 
school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues facing 
gay students, and 42 percent do not have policies to protect students 
from discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian 
and Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last month. 
In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled with an electronic 
avalanche of condolences, city police detectives were investigating 
a different kind of e-mail. On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, 
two gay organizations, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community 
Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The 
messages closed with the words: ``I hope it happens more often.''
