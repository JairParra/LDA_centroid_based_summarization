At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to 
a ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, 
battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay 
college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. On 
Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma 
in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 
21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, 
aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two women described 
as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera 
Pasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted 
first-degree murder. Shepard's friends said that he did not know his 
alleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery, 
although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality 
may also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate 
crime. ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an anthropology 
student here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for that because 
it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree.'' 
A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch 
man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend 
of Shepard's. ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two 
men came up and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university 
lecturer of social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated 
he was gay, and they said they were gay, too.'' ``Now, he is in a 
coma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in 
Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't think anybody expects 
him to pull through.'' Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied 
at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United 
States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his 
father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard 
was born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much 
of his youth there. But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling 
as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie 
and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, 
this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found 
himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless 
landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy 
freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber 
sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this 
Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season 
in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills 
itself as the ``equality state,'' in reference to its being the first 
state to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly 
voted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give 
homosexuals special rights. ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' 
Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize 
that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened 
homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing 
plant.'' Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university 
within days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which 
drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and 
straights. ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled 
the bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.'' 
Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today 
that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard 
out to McKinney's pickup truck. Beating him inside the truck, the 
pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural 
subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, 
the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped 
him with a .357 magnum ``while he begged for his life.'' Relatives 
said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body. After nearly beating 
the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, 
the assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the 
fence. The police commander said that when his officers arrested the 
two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 
magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. 
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police 
commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody 
clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks. 
Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. 
Ms. Price lived with McKinney. The police did not say what the other 
three did for a living. On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled 
to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false 
sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plans 
on Tuesday night for ``Gay Awareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series 
of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of ``National 
Coming Out Day'' and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author 
of ``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' a book about lesbian families. ``If 
I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low,'' said 
Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. ``Openly gay behavior is not 
only discouraged, it's dangerous.''
