As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after 
a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as ``Wyoming's 
hometown,'' wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men. On Saturday, 
at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, ``Pistol 
Pete'' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger 
group of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying 
signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who 
suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week. ``Hate is not 
a Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil,'' read one sign, as 
watchers applauded. With passersby spontaneously joining the protest 
group, two women held another sign that read, ``No Hate Crimes in 
Wyoming.'' Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches 
near the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., 
where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has 
received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets 
to other patients. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew 
about 500 people. ``We live in the Equality State,'' Shannon Rexroat 
wrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus 
newspaper. Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state 
to grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's 
editor added: ``That means nothing to me anymore. We live in a state 
where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay.'' But others 
recalled another side of ``Wyoming's hometown,''which has a population 
of more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday 
he was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed 
away from him and used an anti-gay epithet. Last week's brutal assault 
bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and 
lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published 
Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. ``This 
incident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying 
motive,'' wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. Gay people in 
Laramie, they wrote, ``are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, 
insult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes.'' Ric Turley, who dropped 
out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving 
here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized 
billboard on the main highway. Under a brace of pistols, an advertising 
appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from 
``Shoot a Day or Two,'' to ``Shoot a Gay or Two.'' Turley, who is 
gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that 
he immediately complained to the museum. But returning a month later, 
he found the message had not been erased. After complaining to the 
museum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint 
and blotted out the word ``gay.'' ``It was this kind of complacency 
and apathy that allowed this to happen,'' he said of the beating in 
which two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron 
McKinney. According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men 
lured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. Then, the Laramie 
police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a 
.357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until 
a passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious. On Sunday, 
the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday 
at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated. 
McKinney was being treated for a ``minor'' skull fracture unrelated 
to the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. 
President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, ``I 
was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew 
Shepard.'' Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act, saying, ``There is nothing more important to the future 
of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice 
and violent bigotry.'' Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have 
a hate crime law. The latest attempt died in the state Legislature 
in Cheyenne in February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, 
said he was ``outraged and sickened'' by the attack. Here in Laramie, 
McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack. His pickup truck 
was apparently used in the kidnapping. But he also complained about 
the massive attention by the national media. The national press ``blew 
it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual,'' McKinney 
told The Denver Post. `Had this been a heterosexual these two boys 
decided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national 
news.'' Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high 
school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was transferred 
to Saudi Arabia. The young man completed high school at a boarding 
school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. 
On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement 
from Fort Collins thanking ``the American public for their kind thoughts 
about Matthew.'' ``He is a trusting person who takes everybody at 
face value and he does not see the bad side of anyone,'' the Shepards 
wrote. ``He has always strongly felt that all people are the same, 
regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion.'' Noting 
that their son was born prematurely and that his ``life has often 
been a struggle,'' they added, ``He is physically short in stature, 
but we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth 
of others.''
