A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international 
space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era 
in international space colonization. Russian space officials and others 
cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated 
from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers 
(125 miles) above the Earth. ``Success,'' shouted one exultant official 
some 10 minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit. 
The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in the 
project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers 
(3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had prepared the launch 
were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic 
rocket fuel. Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was ``flawless'' 
and the module performed well during initial tests. They cautioned 
that much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station 
project up and working. ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 
1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of 
the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is 
going to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference 
after the launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch 
was a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving 
it could play a major role in space operations. ``Today we made a 
truly epoch-making step to carry out this project. The Russian space 
industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of 
its commitments on the international space station,'' he said. The 
launch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the cloudy sky 
above the central Asian steppes. The huge roar of the rocket reverberated 
for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the empty plain around the 
base. The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with 
space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to 
ensure there were no problems. Solar power panels on the module were 
successfully deployed shortly after it reached its first orbit and 
all systems were working normally, officials said. The launch of the 
Russian cargo module, which had been delayed for more than a year, 
ushers in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rivals. 
Space officials expressed optimism that cooperation would further 
promote world stability following the end of the Cold War. ``We still 
have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aimed at each 
other, but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing 
things together,'' said Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. 
The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched by a three-stage 
Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat 
in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and 
communications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday 
for the liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under 
cloudy skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40 
seconds later. The international space station, the U.S.-led successor 
to Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be 
completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that 
will take 45 assembly flights to complete. Russia's crucial participation 
has been hampered by the country's financial problems. The launch 
of the first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because the 
chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford to complete 
another part of the station that is to go up later. Zarya is to fly 
alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle 
Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting 
module. The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early 
2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to 
blast off next July or August. The space station is expected to cost 
at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 
24 billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts 
and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. Russia has repeatedly failed 
to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module, putting the whole 
project behind schedule. Having lost hope of getting promised government 
funds, the Russian space agency has sold research time on the station 
to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Russia rents 
the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.
