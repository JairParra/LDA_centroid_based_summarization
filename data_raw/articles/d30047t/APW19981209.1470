Two astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to 
attach antennas to the international space station under construction 
nearly 250 miles above Earth. For the second time this week, Jerry 
Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour 
to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open 
cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas 
to Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other 
job, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna 
on Zarya, the Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour 
spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night's 
outing, during which Ross and Newman hooked up 40 electrical connections 
between Zarya and Unity. The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size 
antennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides 
of the 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, the antennas will provide 
a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity 
and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would 
have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations. 
The electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be made 
inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the orbiting 
station for the first time. Other spacewalking chores for Ross and 
Newman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer 
mounted to the outside of Unity. Mission Control decided just before 
the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. 
Flight controllers urged caution. The antenna was rolled up on a spool, 
and engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough 
force to hurt him if he got too close. Newman had a 10-foot grappling 
hook for the job. The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly 
following Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan. One more spacewalk 
is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman 
will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will 
be used by future station visitors. Newman also may try to unjam the 
other Zarya antenna. This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during 
his 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for 
Newman.
