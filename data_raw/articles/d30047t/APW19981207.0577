Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first 
piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control 
module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. 
Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered 
the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, 
the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned 
Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces are so 
big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined 
mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to 
have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather 
than direct line of sight. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been 
attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time 
for the tasks. ``The main thing I've tried to do for the last two 
years working on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin 
on everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning 
their final approach to Zarya _ Russian for Sunrise _ the shuttle's 
six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched 
last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots to 
fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour 
and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the 
orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little 
too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by 
far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling 
with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been 
assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, 
a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on 
Nov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering 
for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can 
be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve 
as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case 
Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking 
astronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts 
would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and 
cables between the two components. In all, three spacewalks were planned 
for Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 
159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble 
the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station 
will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, 
and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
