James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the 
sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights 
leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement 
officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations 
at abortion clinics. The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police 
records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper 
accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an 
itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly 
abrasive protests at abortion clinics. Federal law enforcement officials 
say he is not currently a suspect in the Slepian shooting, and there 
was no indication Wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent 
acts. At several abortion protests, he was charged with trespassing 
or resisting arrest, according to news accounts. One of his arrests 
was in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protests 
there in 1988. While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the 
nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend links him to the 
violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series 
of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like 
Slepian over the last five years. Responsibility for some of the violence 
_ like the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier 
this year, in which an off-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed 
in notes signed by a shadowy ``Army of God.'' An underground manual 
issued in the name of the Army of God, which describes methods for 
attacking abortion clinics, including how to make homemade C-4 plastic 
explosives, begins with a tribute, by nickname, of a clandestine band 
pledged to stop abortions. The first name under this ``Special Thanks'' 
section is Atomic Dog. The Atlanta police, after searching the hundreds 
of arrest records of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed 
Wednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number 
of the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday 
by the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of Slepian, 
who was gunned down through the window if his home in suburban Amherst 
on Oct. 23. At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that 
the FBI gave as Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who 
gave his name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp 
well. He lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents, 
who were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of protesters 
who tried to shut down two abortion clinics in Burlington in stubborn 
demonstrations that year. Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice 
guy,'' who did chores around the place but paid no rent to the parents. 
He sometimes made wooden toys or played video games with Kenny, then 
a child. ``But the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement,'' 
Kenny recalled. ``He was known among these people as Atomic Dog. It 
wasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But 
if you knew anything about him, that's what you called him.'' Roughly 
95 people were arrested during the protests, according to newspaper 
accounts at the time. ``There were many, many arrests,'' recalled 
Allie Stickney, the president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New 
England. ``It was very big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite locks 
and leaflets from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It was 
clearly a highly organized blockade.'' According to newspaper accounts, 
Kopp was arrested outside a clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991. 
The protests in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point for 
a hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police cracked down hard 
and carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated prison dormitory 
the called ``the farm.'' Operation Rescue had mounted a series of 
blockades to close down abortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia 
that spring. Atlanta was their high point, but in the face of the 
tough arrest policy, the movement faltered, split apart and stalled. 
``It was a traumatic, life-changing experience,'' said Frederick Clarkson, 
author of ``Eternal Hostility,'' a book on the anti-abortion movement, 
adding that by 1993 with the shooting of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion 
provider in Florida, some of those in the Atlanta jail became the 
nucleus of a group signing a ``justifiable homicide'' statement that 
declared that the use of force was warranted to ``defend the life 
of an unborn child.''
