By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and 
her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, 
and every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek 
before he goes to work. She runs errands, like other suburban moms, 
and spends much of her day taking care of her children. But one thing 
sets Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a devoted opponent of 
abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a 
series of traveling speakers, priests and protesters _ many of whom 
have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion 
and shutting down clinics that provide it. She is one of thousands 
of people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion 
groups like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their homes to the 
Lambs' founder, the Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. 
While many _ including Mrs. Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters 
of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility 
when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. 
``These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when 
he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent,'' said Ann 
Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood 
Federation. ``It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the 
extremist activity that is taking place at these clinics. They are 
still guilty of interfering with women's access.'' But Mary Quinn, 
a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home 
to protesters, sees matters in a differing light. ``Taking people 
in like this is an act of Christian charity,'' Mrs. Quinn said. `People 
who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those 
of us that who don't want to lose their stupid houses. We take in 
these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice.'' Members 
of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at 
the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before 
he was shot to death last month. Although no suspect has been identified 
in the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada 
over the past several years, officials are looking to question a Vermont 
man whose car was seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles 
Kopp, has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade, 
and often was a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ. 
While Mrs. Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic's 
door, some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about 
doing so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, is one of those 
who has benefited from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of 
the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well. He prides himself 
on being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical 
clinics. And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he was active in 
clinic ``rescues,'' in which protesters tried physically to restrain 
patients trying to enter clinics. Weslin stayed at Mrs. Hayes' home 
only once, beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local 
churches about the anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that 
lasted several months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking 
access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. 
He was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison. 
During the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters 
locked themselves in a homemade contraption called ``the oven,'' made 
of cement and iron. It took police officers several hours to lug the 
device to a horse trailer that carted it off. At the same protest, 
one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic, 
a move some protesters later said was an accident. Abortion opponents 
like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances 
at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn. They talk 
about counseling women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic 
``pregnancy centers,'' and their support of anti-abortion candidates. 
But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block 
access to clinics. They describe the activity as peaceful resistance 
meant to stop what they see as murders. Weslin and the other house 
guests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended from friends 
and members of local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most 
are speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. And although 
they say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted 
by the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little 
about their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a 
lot about Weslin. An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion 
movement for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for 
unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious 
he was a man of peace who ``had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed 
Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs.'' Barbara 
Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed ties to 
the Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that the priest epitomized 
a man of God. ``I just knew when I looked at his holy shoes and his 
simple coat that had been mended 50 times,'' she said. ``He was humble, 
a man who was doing this for a higher purpose, trying to save people 
through sacrifice and prayer.'' opp also has robust defenders among 
the people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest 
to protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parents housed Kopp in their 
St. Albans, Vt., home for two years after he spoke at their local 
church in 1988. During Kopp's stay, he was a pleasure, Kenny said, 
always helping around the house. ``He was a nice guy, kind of like 
an uncle to us,'' Kenny said. ``He'd sit around and play video games 
with us and make us model planes out of wood.'' Like Weslin, Kopp 
was consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its 
evils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was a gentle man who wanted to 
become a Catholic priest. ``He was always in a good mood,'' Kenny 
said. ``He never did anything violent at all.'' Both Kopp and Weslin 
have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests. The men have 
moved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at 
the same events. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent 
telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached 
for comment, but it is clear that the two men have encountered each 
other. Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington, 
Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called ``the mill.'' And they 
spent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. 
Slepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn 
worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media 
and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ. 
``For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't 
being heard,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ``And then there was this horrible 
tragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of the movement. 
``We're about saving lives,'' she said. The FBI has not talked to 
Mrs. Hayes, but Kenny said that agents have spoken to him. The Justice 
Department says that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate 
the killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion 
violence at various clinics. ``It's fair to say that when investigating 
these events, we will look at any connection between individuals engaged 
in criminal conduct,'' Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department, 
said. Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have 
tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They are 
mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their 
movement. In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering 
other possible explanations for the killing. Some say they believe 
that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a 
personal experience with abortion. Others wondered whether the shooter 
had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing 
more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents 
are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient. 
One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed 
on their Web site, suggests that the killing was the result of a plot 
by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before 
last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know the truth. 
``There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the 
clinic because we are drawn to the same place,'' she said. ``But you 
don't know everyone who shows up and you don't turn to the person 
next to you and tell them they don't belong there.'' Mrs. Fredericks 
said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was 
someone ``who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the 
situation.'' Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of 
abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder 
their efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought 
new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel 
pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said. ``In 
many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading 
rosary marches'' against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. ``But with Father 
Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we 
were doing something sacrificial as a group.'' Mrs. Hayes said that 
she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she 
heard women speak about ``choice'' in regard to abortion. Then she 
saw ``Silent Scream,'' a well-known anti-abortion film that purports 
to show the footage of an abortion. ``What I saw was the end of life,'' 
she said. She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where 
she encouraged women ``not to kill their child.'' She also began to 
house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics 
where abortions were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old 
daughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant, 
a sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door. 
She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone 
else's child. ``Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been 
a partial-birth abortion,'' Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a controversial 
late-term abortion procedure. ``They have the hardest time getting 
the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. ``It's 
brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby? There's 
no question that these doctors are trying to murder a child.''
