Federal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician 
who performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material 
witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his 
arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning. The man was identified 
as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans, 
Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said. Investigators 
said Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett 
Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion 
clinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed. Kopp, 
according to police records and abortion rights groups, has often 
moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics, 
and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods 
of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, 
the U.S. attorney for the western district of New York, said Kopp 
was not considered a suspect at this time but was believed to have 
information material to the case. She declined to give details on 
what evidence was being sought from Kopp, describing it only as information 
that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise 
the ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed 
for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information 
that is important to a case. ``If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, 
brought to Buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence,'' 
Ms. O'Donnell said. ``Then, most likely, the individual would be released.'' 
Slepian, 52, was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on 
Oct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue. 
He was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons 
when the bullet crashed through a back window. He died two hours later. 
Law enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement of the material 
witness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the potential 
danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a 
Canadian holiday that falls on Nov. 11 and that the authorities have 
associated with some anti-abortion crimes. At the same time, the Justice 
Department and the FBI were trying to find ways to step up the federal 
response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the Slepian 
killing. The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would 
soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the 
visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local 
jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort 
focused on abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, 
including Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have met with physician 
and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance 
federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies. 
Federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force 
in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit, which was 
charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed, 
spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence. The unit 
disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy. Law enforcement 
officials said that the unit's operation did help reduce violence 
at abortion clinics and that, in part, the decision to re-establish 
it was prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renewed message to 
anti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate 
these crimes. Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper 
attacks on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, dating 
from 1994. None of the attacks have been solved. Bernard Tolbert, 
special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, said at a news conference 
here Wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there 
is a link between the five killings. ``There's a possibility they 
could be linked, but certainly no information,'' he said. Tolbert 
gave little information about the subject of the material-witness 
warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, 
with the Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen near Slepian's home 
beginning several weeks before the murder. ``We don't have any idea 
of where he is,'' Tolbert said of Kopp. ``We are looking for him every 
place we can, every place he might be.'' A photograph of Kopp taken 
in January 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around 
the United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation has 
sent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search 
for Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, 
the clinic where Slepian worked. She said naming Kopp a material witness 
in the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers 
at the clinic. ``I don't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic 
feel differently,'' she said. ``I don't want anybody to relax and 
say, `Oh God, they got the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want 
people to be very vigilant.'' The clinic is the last in the Buffalo 
area that is performing abortions. Slepian was one of only a handful 
of doctors in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure 
in the face of pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors 
from outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing 
abortion services.
