In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician 
in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week 
that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility 
that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. The 
unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen 
Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. 
But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian 
in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized 
violence will be done by the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic 
terrorism. For many in the FBI, that's a problem. In contrast to the 
old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery 
on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed 
misgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second 
she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving 
anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation 
could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates 
inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes 
and unpopular ideas. Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves 
from the old J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of 
political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They 
do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological 
war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who 
have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against 
clinics and doctors. Many of those calling for government help were 
once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights 
activists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, 
were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay 
as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence 
program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate 
anti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society 
and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials 
are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions. 
They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry 
in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The 
Justice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; 
agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. 
But investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics 
and staff members. Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the 
problem. The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield 
of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government 
militias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists, 
animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. ``The FBI is 
very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political 
association,'' said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. 
``When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups, 
that all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus 
gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful 
political activity.'' In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings 
of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building 
in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased 
efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program. In 
such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that 
require investigators to find a ``reasonable indication'' that a group 
is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into 
an organization. Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics 
as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. 
Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat 
posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local 
authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups. 
Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger. 
Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by 
the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting 
along society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some agents describe 
it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work. The profile 
fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the 
Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He has 
kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that 
he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, 
James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the 
killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives. He was 
an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. 
Later, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant 
anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that the government 
should do what it does best. ``We should investigate violations,'' 
he said. ``We shouldn't investigate groups.''
