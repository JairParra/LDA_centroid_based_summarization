Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying 
physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, 
most people. There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage 
cans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the 
grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients 
as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby 
killer. Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a 
week, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face. Slepian, 
an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor 
by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. He might crack an occasional 
joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and 
on weekends. Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an 
anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar 
demonstrator outside the clinic. So when he was killed Oct. 23 by 
a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in 
the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern 
of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York 
state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that 
Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted 
as much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted 
in that work, long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to 
the pressure of abortion opponents. ``He was an incredibly fatalistic 
person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is 
nothing you can do about it,'' said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old 
niece. ``And he was incredibly stubborn. He said that women had a 
right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor, 
he was going to provide it for them.'' Slepian is the third doctor 
to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that 
have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the 
nation. To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor. To members 
of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause. 
But Slepian was far from either. In interviews with friends and family 
members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative 
who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who 
had rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had 
no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women 
who had multiple children they did not want or could not support. 
He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become 
emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest 
he was a crusader in either politics or medicine. Rather, he was an 
obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing. Out of contrariness 
and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow 
anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, 
he paid with his life. The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment 
lie, in part, in his upbringing. His was a family that took success 
for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty. To earn money 
for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. 
He made few friends, but those he had were friends for life. When 
their wives were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, 
he flew to their side. Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell 
people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes 
a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because 
it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse. Slepian often 
expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after 
abortion. ``Don't they get it?'' his clinic staff recall him saying 
more than once. He had the same impatience for women like those he 
remembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child 
after child and no means of support. ``He had the contempt for that 
of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it 
in the world,'' Ms. Robb said. He believed that to ban abortions or, 
just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to 
perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found 
so irritating. ``There are 1.5 million abortions performed in this 
country,'' his niece said, ``and he just felt we're not equipped to 
handle 1.5 million unwanted children.'' When he was killed, at the 
age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet 
suburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music 
and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's 
trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. 
His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling 
shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his sons 
into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood 
standards. His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would 
be doctors or earn Ph.D's. ``We grew up in a home where there was 
tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education,'' said Serena 
Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older than him. ``If you 
got an A, it was OK If you got a B, you got yelled at.'' The family's 
means did not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, had 
joined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes. 
Soon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so 
to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' 
apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, 
Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscrossing 
the country in his old Studebaker, researching the origins of prominent 
citizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for 
small-town newspapers. He sold articles by the hundreds, and was still 
writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. The success 
that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily. As a child, 
he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister 
recalled. An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college 
before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored 
in zoology. Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the 
fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied 
one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University 
for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him as funny 
and obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline 
who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool. ``Bart had certain 
beliefs, strongly held,'' said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who 
is an internist on Long Island. ``He always said you shouldn't sit 
around whining about things,'' Schwarz said. ``He would say, `Go after 
what's yours and what's right.''' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced 
in quirky ways. He once insisted on going to the top of the World 
Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights. To get to the window, 
he crawled, inch by inch. ``I said, `You don't have to do this,' '' 
recalled Schwarz, who was with him at the time. ``And he said, `I 
want to do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive.'' Forced to drop 
out of school every few semesters to work, he lived in Reno with his 
sister Serena, a widow who was struggling to take care of two young 
daughters. She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing 
her tips with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barns at a ranch and 
worked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration 
hospital. After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency. 
There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his 
junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice 
from a doctor who was about to retire. He had a soothing, unhurried 
manner. When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes, 
Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for 
months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for 
her insulin injections. ``The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,''' 
Mrs. Durlak recalled. ``Not Dr. Slepian.'' In most ways, he was a 
typical suburban family man, working six days a week and spending 
his free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four 
sons. But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo 
were under siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, 
the Rev. Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion 
leaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled into 
the clinic driveway. Slepian parked on the street. As he pushed his 
way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his 
hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, ``Slepian, you pig!'' 
Slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private 
life were futile. The protests followed him home and the man who had 
been so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center 
of controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, 
when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his 
home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor 
came out brandishing a baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, but 
a town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window 
and pay a portion of another's medical bills. The outburst surprised 
his family and friends. It was not Slepian's style to make a public 
fuss, much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters. 
``Stress?'' his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about 
the doctor's mood. ``I never heard the word used in my family, except 
as an engineering term. He said it was a nuisance.'' Mrs. Slepian 
did not respond to requests for an interview. She expressed rage to 
The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She said that whoever 
had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would 
be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also spoke 
out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader 
who frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. 
Slepian denounced him as ``a hypocrite.'' After the confrontation 
in 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and 
levity to deal with the protesters. In 1993, when a man active in 
the anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor's 
garbage cans at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. 
``They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers,'' he joked. He 
tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper. He told The 
Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to 
helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and 
counseling. In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly 
calling him a murderer, his critics were inciting violence. Slepian 
accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction, 
his friends said, but resented the personal attacks. ``He thought 
it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger,'' 
said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took a step that 
few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He 
insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom. 
To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety, Slepian 
began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized 
outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked 
two days a week. He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing 
for what they euphemistically called a ``house call,'' or demonstration 
at the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. 
Robert Behn, to breakfast. Their hourlong conversation the next morning 
was inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an ``attempt 
to get people to like him.'' He asked Slepian how performing abortions 
affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor said, 
``I'm fine spiritually.'' Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time 
away from home with his family. He planned to take a cruise next spring. 
He bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. ``He 
had so many plans,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple 
for 15 years. ``He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet.'' Still, 
sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear. 
When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift, 
Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would 
teach it his eulogy. ``He would talk about the funeral he wanted,'' 
Mrs. Fink said. ``He said he didn't have a lot of friends and wanted 
all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have 
a long procession.'' In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons 
to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality. A medical checkup had 
revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting a conversation 
with Mrs. Slepian the day of the slaying. A blockage is a sign of 
probable coronary artery disease. He was to have more tests the following 
week. ``I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,''' Mrs. Fink 
recalled. That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax 
to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks 
on abortion doctors that occurred in early November. Marilynne Buckham, 
the clinic director, sent it to Slepian. ``He definitely took it seriously,'' 
she recalled. Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he 
might have felt. ``It was a normal day,'' said Tammi Latini, his office 
assistant. ``We were horsing around.' That evening, the Slepians went 
to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's 
father. Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed 
through the kitchen window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his 
wife and sons. The protesters returned to the clinic five days later, 
the first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, said Slepian 
would not have been surprised. They have their routine. So did he. 
``He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,'' she said. ``At the 
end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And he 
would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me.'''
