On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, 
the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of 
an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last 
month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions 
or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994. 
The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five 
similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats 
and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James 
Charles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning as a witness about the 
Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Five days after the shooting, 
the Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier 
with biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph 
of him that had been crossed out. ``It certainly causes us to be more 
interested than ever in speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill 
of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United 
States task force investigating the five shootings. Even as they searched 
for Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that 
were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in 
Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Those letters, saying they contained 
the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats 
to clinics that provide abortions. All the letters appear to be hoaxes, 
and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five 
shootings. Kopp is not a suspect in the shootings. An itinerant antiabortion 
activist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is the subject 
of warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he is suspected 
of administrative violations of immigration law; in the United States, 
he is wanted as a material witness in the Slepian case.
