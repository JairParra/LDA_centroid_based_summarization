In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his 
home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion 
protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation 
Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the 
van riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation 
Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And, those people 
say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's 
``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail. Along with more 
than one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according to some 
people who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered 
to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts. 
After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton 
headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as the group's 
power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 
and 1989, according to the former leaders of Operation Rescue. Now, 
Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities 
for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician 
who performed abortions in the Buffalo region. The authorities also 
say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper 
attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New 
York. Some abortion-rights groups are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation 
Rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent 
anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups 
that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s. For years, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have looked 
in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might 
be behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and 
other clinic staff members that began in the early 1990s. A federal 
grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into conspiracy allegations 
was ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground. But 
some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may 
help provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that law enforcement 
officials are looking for him has been made as Attorney General Janet 
Reno has prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once 
again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Federal 
law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now 
a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett 
A. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car was seen near Slepian's 
home in Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks before the doctor was shot. One 
day after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material witness, 
law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies spanning the United 
States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But 
law enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips, including 
about 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line: (800) 
281-1184. The police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters 
and clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they are 
also reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in 
search of Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider the shooting 
of Slepian to be connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester 
on doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all since 1994, 
occurred in the weeks leading up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day _ called 
Remembrance Day in Canada _ a holiday that has become important to 
anti-abortion activists. But the attacks were spread over four years 
and 3,000 miles, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo. As 
is the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue, Kopp was 
transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta 
in 1988, according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted 
on anonymity.
