While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday 
to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling 
vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement. 
There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed 
to be at large. And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this 
country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find 
access diminishing. There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked 
to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day 
to commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, a sniper has 
used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor 
who performs abortion, each time wounding the target. The attacks 
were spread across Canada _ Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. 
U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked 
to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, 
including the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near 
Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted 
for questioning about the shootings. Police say they don't know which 
side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals 
throughout Canada. ``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended 
border in the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. Many women's 
clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions 
have been urged to take precautions. ``I would suggest they be extremely 
aware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business 
day or after hours,'' said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across 
Canada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying 
their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions. Some wear 
bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes. Abortion-rights 
groups say most doctors are not backing down. ``There's a great deal 
of sadness,'' said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, 
that provides abortions. ``But there's also a feeling of determination 
that we won't be deterred or scared by these actions.'' Marilyn Wilson, 
executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, 
sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young 
doctors from entering the field. ``There are almost no doctors who 
have stopped performing these procedures, even under the current reign 
of terror,'' she said. ``But young doctors with families wouldn't 
necessarily want to do this. They may not be willing to put their 
lives at risk.'' The abortion debate is only one of several factors 
contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. 
The national society that oversees the speciality says there are about 
1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their 
50s or 60s. The society says long hours and limits on fees paid by 
the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical 
school graduates as they choose a specialty. Another problem is that 
few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion. Women in 
Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions. Those 
in rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince 
Edward Island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals, forcing women 
there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups 
say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available 
in Canada. No drug company has applied for permission to market the 
pill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability. The government 
has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the 
health department says this can't be done. ``It would be a conflict 
of interest,'' said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. 
``As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge 
an application impartially.'' Abortion was illegal in Canada until 
1988. Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions 
are performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters 
of Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't 
spare doctors from fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to 
overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed 
in 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom 
as they reluctantly increase security measures. ``Unfortunately, doctors 
who are committed to providing these services will have to accept 
a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life,'' he said.
