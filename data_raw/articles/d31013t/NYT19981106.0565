Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before 
Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of 
Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested. She was there before 
Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993. She was on the 
sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, 
about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally 
shot in his home. And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in 
her hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly 
praying for abortions to stop. ``I'm heartbroken when I have to come 
here,'' Mrs. Lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wearing 
small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver 
pin of baby feet. ``It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,'' 
she said, after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk 
to a reporter. The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents 
and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the 
news media, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldiers in 
the abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come 
to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. 
They pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. Some 
scream profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only 
the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of 
doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. 
For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is 
more like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule. People 
count on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother 
of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in 
which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two 
decades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the fetus 
was male or female. ``I just felt horrible and I felt guilty,'' she 
said, tears in her eyes. ``I thought that if I was at the clinic doing 
something, I could make up for that baby's life.'' During Mrs. Lotempio's 
8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area 
in front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the ``Hail Mary.'' Others take 
her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She returns on Saturdays, when 
up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. Similar bands of protesters march 
in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local 
protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country. 
At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is 
an odd sense of community. Local protesters greet Dick, the security 
guard, by name. They sometimes see the ``enemy'' _ abortion-rights 
volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket 
or on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even 
spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with 
Slepian. And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's 
death. Most of the protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among 
the thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion 
activity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned, 
for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will 
not be there. Instead, she plans to stay in church and pray, to avoid 
the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, a lawyer 
for Womenservices clinic, said: ``When people from out of town show 
up, that is when we feel the most danger. The local people are a known 
quantity. We know most of the local people by name.'' Buffalo has 
been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the 
last decade. It is a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters 
from around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992. They failed 
to close abortion clinics, but 500 people were arrested in rallies 
that snarled traffic and drew national headlines. Those rallies, as 
well as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had 
an impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say. The number 
of clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped to 
one from three. And after Slepian's death and the retirement this 
week of another doctor, there are only two doctors in the area for 
whom abortions form a significant part of their practices. The daily 
demonstrators count this as progress. But their perch outside the 
clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders 
than what they call rescues. About 30 women a day might go into the 
clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who 
changed their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the 
clinic. Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder, 
many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat the 
rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the 
parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. 
They ask questions like ``Do you know what your baby looks like?'' 
or ``Is it a boy or a girl?'' Sometimes they accuse people of murder 
and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. Federal law 
bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances, 
and from leaning signs against its walls. Some push the limits, frustrating 
clinic workers and guards. The rules protect people from physical 
harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet 
conversations into catcalls and taunts. When a patient goes into the 
clinic, the protesters ``take on a different persona,'' said Melinda 
DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. ``They scream and yell and 
call us names. They lie. Some days we're immune to it, but other days 
it's just too much.'' Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, 
said she identified with the clinic patients. When she was 23, she 
said, she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant 
herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. She 
began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march 
in Albany.
