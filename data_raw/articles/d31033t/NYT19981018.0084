The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft 
Corp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable. 
The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy 
has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending 
on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts. 
Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger 
brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act 
was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the 
industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and 
small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts 
as vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national 
holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization 
and industrialization. Economists at the time opposed the Sherman 
Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. 
No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in 
Matthew Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone 
agreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive masses.'' 
The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention ``conspiracy,'' 
``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to monopolize.'' Yet while the 
Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition, 
it never uses the term. After it was passed, critics of the trusts 
derided the ``impenetrable'' language of the Sherman Act and called 
it the Swiss Cheese Act. But by the early 1900s, the political climate 
had changed. The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as 
income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore 
Roosevelt, who became president in 1901. ``The Sherman Act has always 
been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived 
exploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor 
at the New York University Law School. The model trust _ and the principal 
target of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt 
made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their 
superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result 
of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices. 
Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained 
about the company and the business practices of its founder, John 
D. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned 
to light the nation's homes _declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it 
could could reasonably be argued, was an ``enterprising monopoly.'' 
In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United 
States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price 
war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face 
genuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil 
monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company 
swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard 
Taft. The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and 
the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911. Standard 
Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. 
Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft 
chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller. ``But there is no 
presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction 
in the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a 
best-selling biography of Rockefeller. ``And Rockefeller,'' Chernow 
added, ``never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread 
public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had.''
