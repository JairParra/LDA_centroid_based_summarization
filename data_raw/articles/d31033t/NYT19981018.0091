Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft 
Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge 
of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon 
Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein that unless 
a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little 
effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer 
industry. Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's 
concerns. But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence 
in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications 
Corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating 
the Internet. ``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein 
saying. But five months later, the case that the government is bringing 
to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war 
to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad 
pattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft. Netscape, the 
government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but 
only one of several examples. The 12-person witness list for the Justice 
Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence 
added to the case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president 
and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by 
executives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology 
companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, 
America Online and Intuit. In bringing a more ambitious, complicated 
case to trial than the one it filed in May, the government has chosen 
a high-risk strategy. The law states that new evidence can be added 
to a suit after it is filed, but not new charges. And so, in his federal 
courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far 
afield from the original suit. But if the government wins its broadened 
case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on 
Microsoft. In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal 
treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the 
government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on 
remedies, if it wins the case. The remedies under consideration now 
include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _ perhaps 
even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft's grip 
on computing. That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform 
that Microsoft's foes would applaud. ``The government has doubled 
the bet and doubled the stakes,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at 
the Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, ``Competing 
on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.'' 
Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed 
as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened 
to undermine the antitrust suit. That ruling came in a separate case, 
involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft 
signed with the Justice Department in 1995. In the June ruling, a 
federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser 
with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them 
one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion 
in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the 
operating system were two separate products, bundled together and 
given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. 
``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart 
of its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the 
Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft. ``So it 
has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything 
it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years 
_ into the gun barrel and see what hits.'' The June appellate ruling 
did shake the prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened the hand 
of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the 
case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation. 
At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation 
moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule 
approved by the court. Speed was a priority from the outset, they 
say. The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May 
to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced 
in June. While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government 
lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as 
PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system 
for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold. The key allegations, 
government lawyers note, have not changed since May _ namely, that 
Microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to 
defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets. 
``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the 
May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case. 
``The real game plan was always to get a broader case.'' What is more, 
one person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until 
shortly before the suit was filed. David Boies, a renowned courtroom 
litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who 
successfully defended IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government, 
was named as special counsel for the Justice Department last December. 
But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time 
for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing 
private cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust 
suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning 
Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the 
complaint and a supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned 
Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an 
Internet programming language, and cited it as an ``example'' of Microsoft's 
behavior. ``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without 
much stretching,'' one person involved in the case said. And so, as 
new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step 
by step approved the widening of the case, the person said. And that 
explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been 
in the hands of the Justice Department for years has been added to 
the case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become 
apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case. 
For example, the government has added the contention that Microsoft 
pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner 
of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet 
software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans. The government 
contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two 
companies three years ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which was 
attended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the 
Microsoft chairman. Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft 
episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady, 
an Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written 
by him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, said that 
Gates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's investments 
in the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.'' A handwritten note, also 
under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying 
that Netscape is their ``common enemy'' and that Intel's role should 
be to ``fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.'' These 
documents were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in 
San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative 
Demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995. On its 
own, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the 
antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to 
the case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried 
to urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software in 
the Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull 
back in the market for so-called streaming software. The government 
case has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more 
witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify. 
``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the 
government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,'' 
one person said. ``But as the strength of our case was perceived to 
improve, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed. 
You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on.''
