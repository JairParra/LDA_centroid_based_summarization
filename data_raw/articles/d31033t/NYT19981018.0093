Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, 
as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which federal 
antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times 
_ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison 
terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted 
of violating it. In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked 
the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's 
business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties. 
An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and 
Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of 
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared 
to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage 
in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine 
not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding 
one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. 
Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, 
or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize 
any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand 
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said 
punishments, in the discretion of the court.
