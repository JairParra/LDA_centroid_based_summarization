In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon 
Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity 
for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the 
personal computer software business. Leading the challenge was Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web 
had ignited the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke 
boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the 
movie ``Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and 
Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answered with 
a vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing 
browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it. It 
prodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser, folded 
the browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and 
gave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their 
air supply,'' as a senior Microsoft executive described it. But not 
only competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. 
Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors 
who finance new ventures have all collided with it. A close look at 
Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business 
offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to 
influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. 
Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought 
by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to trial 
this month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _ and violated 
antitrust laws. Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported 
details about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide 
a more complete picture of Microsoft in action. _ When Compaq Computer 
Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's 
on its personal computers, Microsoft threatened to stop selling its 
Windows operating system to Compaq. The company quickly changed its 
mind. _ After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with its early 
browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its 
browser free. The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner Spyglass. 
The company lost most of its revenues almost overnight, as the technology, 
which it had also been licensing to companies besides Microsoft, suddenly 
became available free. _ When America Online Inc., which competes 
fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, 
went shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that 
was too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser 
as the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give 
America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal 
computers using Windows. _ When Intel Corp. began developing its own 
Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker 
of the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most 
personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided 
that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft took priority. 
_ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly 
every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately 
with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's 
plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, was to ``stay out 
of the way of the steamroller.'' Microsoft adamantly denies that it 
has broken any laws in these or similar situations. The company plays 
the game of business hard, and its executives acknowledge that without 
apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be 
irritated occasionally. But the company insists its actions are guided 
by its main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively 
and conveniently to the millions of people who use its software. Most 
people in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world 
means routinely making accommodations to it. Microsoft's power emanates 
from its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating 
systems, the master control programs that run computers. ``Because 
it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the essential utility of 
the information age,'' said James Moore, president of Geopartners 
Research Inc., a technology consulting firm. ``It acts as a kind of 
gatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation, sitting there 
and deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down.'' For 
months, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off, circling each 
other warily. But the event that would define them as unflinching 
rivals was a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference 
room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, 
according to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, 
was the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled 
railroad cars that inspired passage of the nation's antitrust laws 
a century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal 
offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion 
pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors 
are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and 
that the company has never tried to divide the browser market. Bill 
Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend 
the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the 
Microsoft team. Two people who did attend that June meeting have been 
named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape 
president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager 
of new technology. In the trial, the government will contend that 
Microsoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according 
to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation. Relying 
heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president 
Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are 
expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements, 
both incentives and requirements. Microsoft, according to the people 
questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 
to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune 
Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run 
better on Windows. In return, the people say, Netscape would give 
Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, 
give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts 
and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating 
system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995 
meeting. And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied 
it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business 
negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows 
``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links that enable 
other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating 
system. By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have 
that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft 
fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, 
told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was 
``the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.'' 
Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's 
money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also been free to sell 
its browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on 
other operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful 
system used mainly in corporations and research labs. ``But if we 
had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best 
we could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $100 
million or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft,'' said Clark, 
a former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon 
Graphics Inc., a computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape. 
``We didn't start Netscape for that.'' For any company, a meeting 
with Microsoft is often a charged affair. Every computing device from 
keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to 
browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
This is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but 
it also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper. And 
since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond 
the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position 
of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against 
it. And in the software industry, where every program is rendered 
in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition 
and cooperation are often blurred. The talk about that line at the 
Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating 
system _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the application 
programs, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on top of the operating 
system. The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris 
Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that 
Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete.'' 
Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly 
of the company's clarifying its position. If Netscape stayed on the 
applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies 
could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried to become 
a player in the platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released 
portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the 
government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context. Q. Do 
you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of 
Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence 
Netscape not to compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the 
sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have 
a great business relationship together. Later in the deposition, a 
Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft 
executives intended to suggest that ``there would be any consequences 
to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform 
direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.'' 
Jones replied: ``The conversation was something like the following: 
`We're in the platform business. We're going to invest heavily in 
this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies. 
That's a done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? 
Is your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're 
in the platforms business. We're competing.''' Microsoft portrays 
such comments as innocuous statements of fact. But to Netscape, the 
same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat. This is 
because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an 
alternative platform to the Windows operating system. The browser, 
sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as 
the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming 
for starting other software applications. In addition, Netscape's 
browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running 
Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems 
Inc., a Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform 
could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. 
Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to 
relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath 
the browser. By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape 
as a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown 
jewel. On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal 
Wave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is 
Netscape. Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing 
them to determine which network extensions will catch on.'' Netscape's 
strategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API'' into the browser 
``to commoditize the underlying operating system.'' THE BROADER INQUIRY: 
GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states 
have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding 
evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other 
companies to squelch competition. They say that like the Netscape 
meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, 
which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors 
and partners. One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, 
was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development 
of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with 
Netscape. Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips 
that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run 
the Windows operating system. Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft 
are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred 
to as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.'' But Intel also employs 
hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs 
in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they 
have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace 
at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal 
computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state 
investigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work 
being done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in 
no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., 
headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session was attended 
by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and 
Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates 
made ``vague threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that 
he was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted 
them stopped.'' Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and 
Internet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president 
who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a 
witness for the government. Microsoft replies that the government's 
accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful 
distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and 
witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter 
failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely 
meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will 
work well with Windows. Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on 
to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology 
or a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape. 
In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser 
market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps. 
To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month 
and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, ``Competing 
on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,'' 
which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape 
executives. The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape. 
But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard 
Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. ``Microsoft's 
take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation 
from competitors, the government and even customers,'' Yoffie said. 
Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, 
``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did 
without crossing the line as much as it did.'' THE SPYGLASS LINK: 
REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 
Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the 
company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The subject was the Internet 
and how it might revolutionize the computer software business. Few 
concrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist 
that a direction was set. ``Our vision from the outset was to unite 
the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven 
Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting. Yet Microsoft 
badly trailed Netscape in the browser field. To hasten its entry, 
Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. 
of Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between the two companies was 
initiated by Spyglass in April 1994. At the time, it was a tiny company 
and eager to do a deal with Microsoft. Spyglass was selected as the 
commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National 
Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. In the summer 
of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of 
Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The two men talked 
in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class 
passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, ``We're going 
to take Microsoft head-on.'' At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking 
to himself, ``Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from 
me.'' Today, he noted: ``Remember, we were a company with a couple 
dozen people and almost no money in the bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, 
with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing 
from Silicon Valley. Netscape had a very different agenda.'' By July 
1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, 
Colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement 
the following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him 
that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating 
system, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise. ``Microsoft 
was initially hoping to charge for the browser,'' Colbeth said. But 
on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply 
integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away. The announcement 
caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. At the time, Spyglass 
had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and 
Digital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing 
revenue stream of about $20 million a year. As a result of Microsoft's 
move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller 
Internet software companies went out of business and big customers 
shifted to Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed its payroll 
and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace 
its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually. ``Whenever 
you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can 
someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put 
you out of that business,'' Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY 
SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market 
continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though 
its browser was free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed 
that Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader. In April 1996, 
Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the 
Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, 
according to Zona Research. So the biggest personal computer maker, 
Compaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser 
instead of Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and 
Compaq had no choice but to give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not 
only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but 
also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was 
delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95. Microsoft informed 
Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would 
lose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director 
of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators. The 
ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed, 
``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.'' Faced with being 
denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course 
and kept the Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows 
and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone 
defines what is in the product. Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft 
adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies. 
While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily 
hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer, 
Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that ``to take 
one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft 
as an arrogant company is unfair.'' Noting that a Compaq executive 
is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent 
on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq.'' At Netscape, 
however, the Compaq episode was a watershed. ``That was the singular 
act that got me going to the Justice Department,'' Barksdale recalled. 
Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to 
buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, 
the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof 
that Microsoft was a monopolist.'' After investigating the incident, 
the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft 
was illegally tying the sale of one product to another. Microsoft 
replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating 
system. And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows 
and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, 
as they are now in Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no 
product-tying violation of antitrust laws. In a separate case, a federal 
appeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the 
company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and 
declare it a single product. But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted 
to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most 
industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different 
software programs. ``It took a long time for the integration strategy 
to play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher. ``Back then, 
integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.'' THE `BALANCING 
ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen 
Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.'' 
That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 
1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured 
place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain 
access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed 
to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online 
subscribers, who now number more than 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, 
as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant 
improvement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the 
door of the Justice Department. His complaint was that Microsoft was 
going to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct 
competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of 
Windows 95, which was introduced in August. This bundling tactic of 
using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, 
or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young 
but fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened 
and investigated. But ultimately, the government decided against taking 
any action. At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft 
was both feared and loathed at the time. America Online had a designated 
``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A. who tracked its adversary's 
every move. Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture 
of Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words 
``THE ENEMY.'' Though America Online was the clear leader in the online 
services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault 
by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. When he had visited 
the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled, 
Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could 
buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business 
on his own and ``bury you.'' A threat or merely a statement of the 
facts? ``A bit of both,'' Case said recently. ``But he was mainly 
articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.'' 
Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to 
cooperate. With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide 
Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve, 
had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own 
services. America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with 
the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape 
or Microsoft. For both software companies, a deal with America Online, 
which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge 
in browser use and market share. Netscape seemed the natural partner 
for America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals. On 
March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, 
but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. 
The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with 
Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser 
America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked 
for Netscape's Navigator. To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give 
America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely 
the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had 
asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. ``After we agreed 
to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled 
on the Windows desktop,'' Case said. ``It was an example of Microsoft's 
pragmatic side.'' The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate 
goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay 
software business. As a result, its new online service, MSN, would 
have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, 
America Online. ``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general 
manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. ``He sent me e-mail 
on it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed 
with him.'' To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different 
view of the likely impact on MSN. He told senior vice president Brad 
Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would 
amount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a 
deposition taken by the Justice Department. In the antitrust suit, 
the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft 
used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser 
war against Netscape. David Colburn, a senior vice president of America 
Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is 
a witness for the government. Today, Microsoft has overhauled its 
Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest 
Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing 
and news. And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search 
features, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com. ``I still 
regard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed. ``Microsoft 
has a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no 
reason to think it won't in this business as well. We will always 
be in Microsoft's cross hairs.'' THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER 
At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is 
one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. 
``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson 
learned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's 
venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's 
high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days. 
Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper. For while competing directly 
with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an 
engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. 
And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship 
with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft 
entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which 
has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising 
technology and people. ``Microsoft understands start-up innovation 
and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech 
company,'' said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, 
a venture capital firm. As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be 
seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes 
the business environment, like a weather front. ``Microsoft is incredibly 
pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, 
a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings 
of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always 
come up, he said: ``One is the price of the company's stock, and the 
other is what Microsoft is going to do.'' In the last few years, Microsoft 
has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior 
Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists. The meetings 
are part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations 
with Silicon Valley. ``We work hard to provide clarity about where 
we're going and where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's 
chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place in October 
at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the 
Wall Street of high-tech venture investing. Maffei led a team of five 
Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists, 
one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the 
minds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that stays 
out of the way of the steamroller?'' Maffei, recalled one person who 
attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses 
that Microsoft was likely to avoid. His list included specialized 
software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided 
design and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry 
appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms 
that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system. 
At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture 
Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems 
and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield 
&AMP; Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves us washing machines 
and toasters.''
