The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest 
independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic 
administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators. 
But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated 
public policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics. Instead, like the 
software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has 
taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled 
or predicted back when it started in 1989. It was in November of that 
year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las 
Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd 
been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM 
_ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry. 
The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers 
and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating 
on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. 
But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows. 
The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system 
was going to become the new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably 
at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that 
the two companies wanted to ``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, 
he said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product 
for under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive 
all the advanced features of OS/2. Gates certainly did not look happy. 
But he did not disagree. The news conference got little attention, 
just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. 
But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer 
with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles, 
in Byte magazine. ``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified 
vision of graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and 
it looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-, 
middle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft 
were colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential 
violation of antitrust law. Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation 
of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has 
been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators 
for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month 
after month, year after year, for the last nine years. Now comes the 
antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity 
of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different 
investigative inquiries during that nine-year span. Microsoft, today 
the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market 
value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust 
target. Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton 
administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the 
answer seems to be there is none. In interviews, more than a dozen 
current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of 
the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's 
antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. 
As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division 
operates independent of the administration's political considerations. 
Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust 
division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington 
lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. ``When 
I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White House was 
punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided 
to do. There was no communication between antitrust and other branches 
of government.'' Asked if he believed that policy had changed under 
the Clinton administration, he said: ``Not really. I've seen nothing 
to suggest it.'' Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and 
in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's 
technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, 
he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, 
civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without 
any political contact.'' Klein said, by way of examples, that he might 
discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with 
the Defense Department or Transportation Department. ``But never the 
White House,'' he said. ``For a significant case, we might call the 
White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press 
conference.' '' ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, 
``was the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., 
was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 
donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long way'' 
toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the 
Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the 
memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In 
any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been immaculate.'' In 
the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President 
Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a question during 
a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton 
said: ``I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters 
within the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should 
depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will 
have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have 
to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way 
the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter.'' 
Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly 
at least. And Gore, who generally represents the administration on 
technology issues, has never commented at all. In Rule's opinion, 
the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it 
were politically acceptable to do so. ``It would be a little odd for 
the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,'' 
he said. ``It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I 
would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.'' Taking 
sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly 
since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political 
donations and support. In fact, the present and former government 
officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the 
inquiries conducted during the last nine years. They began at the 
FTC. Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff 
opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But as has happened 
so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial 
inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and 
Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained 
a cipher. But as that issue faded, once government investigators began 
looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them. In 
1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that 
the investigation was being expanded. The agency, his letter said, 
was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant 
position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other 
areas. That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit. One 
former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence 
in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had 
to approve any suit, might have a different view. ``We knew the commission 
might have difficulty with a monopolization case,'' the former official 
said. ``They hadn't brought a case in years.'' And in fact, in 1993 
the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal 
charges. The deadlock served as a dismissal. Then, a few months later, 
the Justice Department decided to pick up the case. ``It was farther 
along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert Litan, a former senior 
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now 
at the Brookings Institution. ``Usually a case would be two or three 
people complaining and a few documents,'' he said. ``But this was 
a fully researched record. They gave us the files and briefed us on 
what they had done.'' The Justice Department lawyers picked up the 
same thread. ``The general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, 
``was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating 
systems to cement a monopoly in other areas.'' In 1995, Microsoft 
and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company 
promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft 
operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every 
computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. 
The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product 
to the sale of another. The charges in the present suit are similar 
in many ways. Even with the agreement, the government investigations 
continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed 
up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time 
to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. ``America Online 
had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive recalled, ``because 
Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,'' a competing online 
service, ``with Windows.'' Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. 
The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America 
Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled 
the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general 
who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get complaints about 
Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints 
center. And we take them very seriously.'' In 1996, Netscape's first 
complaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape 
said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating 
systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's 
browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed 
by Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charged 
Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows 
to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. ``It 
seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,'' a natural 
extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department 
by then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court 
panel overturned that ruling this summer. In the meantime, last May 
the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their 
new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. 
It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other 
predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations 
and investigations of the last nine years. ``A good part of this case 
is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I,'' in the early 
in the 1990s, Litan said. Or, as the former senior FTC official put 
it, ``there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through 
here.'' But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled 
and spun by hundreds of different hands.
