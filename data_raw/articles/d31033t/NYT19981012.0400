Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two 
business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in 
the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But judging from 
an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states 
that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments 
in the book as well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that 
its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer 
browser are a single integrated product. In its suit, the government 
asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled 
together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications 
Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World 
Wide Web. In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and 
Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management 
and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft 
executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's 
browser was it integrated with Windows. Microsoft hurried its first 
browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch 
up with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet 
Explorer 3.0, which was introduced in August 1996. In that version 
it changed its software design to use programming modules, or components, 
that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks. In 
the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying, 
``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,'' 
He added, ``We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.'' 
The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government 
cites as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer 
makers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead 
of Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied the requests, insisting its 
browers and Windows were a single, integrated product. Microsoft's 
legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, 
by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who was given a confidential 
copy by the authors to review. Microsoft has also sought the transcripts 
of 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed by the authors. 
A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that 
research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling. The new 
book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster, 
is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the 
start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19. But already, a few quotes 
from Netscape executives have leaked out. The authors decided to send 
the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news 
organizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context. 
Microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's 
troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any 
alleged predatory practices by Microsoft. The book does detail where 
Netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into 
obstacles in its software development efforts. In private antitrust 
suits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is 
an established defense. But legal experts say that defense may well 
be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is 
seeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather 
than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private 
cases. ``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes 
is a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official 
in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the 
Brookings Institution. ``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it 
seems they are working on every defense they can find.'' The book 
quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company 
bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from 
America Online Inc. But that was a second-chance to do a deal with 
America Online, the leading online service. The government's case 
focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose 
Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft 
agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main 
Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing. For a 
book entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is intriguing that 
one of its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion 
that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, 
by contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled 
the company, the authors write, to ``mesh its short-run tactical plans 
with a broader strategic view of how to win the war.'' The book quotes 
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, ``The fact of the 
matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three 
months. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. 
But you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three 
months.''
