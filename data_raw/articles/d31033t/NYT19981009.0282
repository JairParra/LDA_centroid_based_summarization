A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust 
trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also 
ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request 
to examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued that allowing 
``an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will 
make it very difficult for us to remain in business.'' But after winning 
assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, 
targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft 
to open the database for perusal. Microsoft had asked that the trial 
be delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it 
said was a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, 
which had added new evidence. Last month, the government said that 
in the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft 
tried to persuade Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia 
software to Windows customers. On Thursday, the Justice Department 
and 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify 
about Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. Avi 
Tevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness list 
in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever 
having made. The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive 
who led the development of Java, an Internet programming language 
that Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance 
of the software market. The government is charging that Microsoft 
took illegal steps to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance. To 
counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, 
a senior Microsoft executive who has worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, 
an executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple. 
At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that the 
new allegations had no place in the case. The Justice Department, 
Warden told the judge, was ``trying to turn this into something approximating 
a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case.'' ``It becomes clearer 
and clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying 
to turn this into a broader case,'' he said. ``You can't have this 
bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging A, B, C, and 
then talk about the whole alphabet three times over.'' As a result, 
Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, 
even though ``a more normal schedule'' would have the trial start 
next year. The judge did not respond. Instead he entered an order 
setting the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal 
motion asking for another two-week delay. A response is expected next 
week.
