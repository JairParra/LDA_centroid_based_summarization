Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy? Until 
last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft 
Corp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled 
visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal 
computer. Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice 
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In 
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man 
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal 
computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian schemer 
who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product 
innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. 
Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition 
and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the 
government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of 
payments by the Microsoft chairman. It also sought to cast Gates as 
an obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. 
and its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet 
browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Gates 
was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard 
bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness 
that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator 
and high-technology guru. According to a document presented by Boies, 
for example, Gates asked America Online executives in 1996: ``How 
much do we need to pay you'' to damage Netscape? ``This is your lucky 
day.'' The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant, 
and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes 
as many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its goals. 
Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint 
that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from 
the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public 
will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive 
business tactics and the company's software. ``Despite what you're 
reading in the press, people judge us by our products,'' said Mich 
Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. ``Our 
experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks.'' So far, consumers 
are casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly 
profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the 
level a year earlier. Despite the record profits, some marketing experts 
say that if the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style 
robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. ``When you 
have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really 
the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert 
at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at 
Berkeley. ``There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's 
brand recognition.'' Already there are early warning signals, as political 
cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. 
One showed him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my 
way, I'll take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft 
chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window 
while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr. 
Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.'' But some industry 
analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play 
hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. The he-said, 
she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases 
both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked 
in a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed 
by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that 
goes on in professional sports. ``It's like taking what Charles Barkley 
and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court'' and turning 
it into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, 
co-author with Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, 
there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has 
so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon 
Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates' 
tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. 
In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity. 
Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students 
at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's 
suit was roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times 
News Service Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 
1 or a threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous 
political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country 
last week. From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in 
demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge 
as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. Other cartoons 
ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium 
in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones, saying to some 
visitors, ``Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department'') 
to the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen 
staring at the words: ``Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. 
Leave your possessions. Go to the desert. Await the spaceship''). 
And that was just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned.
