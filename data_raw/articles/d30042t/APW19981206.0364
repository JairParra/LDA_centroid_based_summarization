After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing 
two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be 
secured in the ``not too distant future.'' Annan's comments came Saturday 
after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 
1988 bombing that killed 270 people. On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio 
quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which 
is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution 
to this crisis is within reach.'' He credited Annan's talks with Omar 
al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte 
before Annan went on to talks with Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) east of the Libyan capital Tripoli. The official spoke 
of ``fruitful talks'' but gave no details. The broadcast was monitored 
by the British Broadcasting Corp. Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said in an interview with the BBC that he had spoken with 
Annan on Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.'' He 
added: ``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism.'' 
Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec. 21, 
the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. But Cook said Britain 
will not budge on the demand by Washington and London that the suspects 
serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has asked that any prison 
terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan spoke to reporters 
in Tripoli after the meeting with Gadhafi and later when he arrived 
back at this Tunisian island, where he had begun the day of diplomacy 
that lasted nearly 15 hours. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get 
Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects 
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ``The talks have been fruitful and 
positive,'' Annan said in Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness 
and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya 
has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it 
ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' 
he said. ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be 
able to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the 
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial. Annan 
left Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where he will attend 
a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab 
Gulf states. In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, 
said the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' 
that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley 
said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this 
has gone on for far too long.'' The meeting with Gadhafi took place 
after Libya's official news agency, JANA, reported that Annan might 
not be able to meet with the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in 
the desert.'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on 
an hour's trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet 
with Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside. Earlier, Libyan 
media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects 
_ an indication he was giving himself room in case he decides against 
giving up the two men wanted by the United States and Britain. JANA 
indicated a decision on handing over the two suspects would have to 
be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before being 
considered by the Parliament. Libyan radio reported that the Parliament 
had been called to meet Tuesday in Sirte but did not say whether the 
Lockerbie issue would be discussed. Annan flew into Libya aboard a 
special plane from Jerba after receiving clearance from the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its 
refusal to hand over the two suspects. The U.N. sanctions ban air 
travel in and out of the country but do not cover oil exports, Libya's 
economic lifeblood.
