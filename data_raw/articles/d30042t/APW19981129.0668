Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan 
leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery 
from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported. Improved health 
will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service 
of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by 
the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run 
television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a 
cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, 
Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in Cairo. Gadhafi underwent surgery 
last July after injuring his hip, reportedly while exercising. The 
visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three years. The 
leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently visited in 
December 1997. It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived 
in Libya or how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry 
from Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions 
imposed in 1992 ban air travel to and from the country. Farrakhan 
repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which were imposed to 
try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing 
of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury Department 
prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize he was awarded 
by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work. The Treasury also 
barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer of a dlrs 1 billion 
gift for Nation of Islam activities. His Nation of Islam is a black 
nationalist group that says it is guided by the Koran. It is not considered 
a true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam. Farrakhan's message 
to America's black community is one of self-reliance, discipline, 
spirituality and separatism. Over the years, he has said that whites 
and blacks should live separately, that Jews are ``bloodsuckers'' 
who have a ``gutter religion,'' and that whites are ``subhuman.'' 
He accuses news media of taking his comments out of context.
