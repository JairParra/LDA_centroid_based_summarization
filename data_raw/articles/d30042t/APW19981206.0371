After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing 
two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be 
secured in the ``not too distant future.'' Annan's comments came Saturday 
after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 
1988 bombing that killed 270 people. Annan spoke to reporters in the 
Libyan capital of Tripoli after the meeting and again later when he 
arrived back at this Tunisian island, where he had begun his 15-hour 
stretch of diplomacy. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya 
to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before 
a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, 
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ``The talks have been fruitful and 
positive,'' Annan said in Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness 
and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya 
has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it 
ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' 
he said. ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be 
able to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the 
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial. On 
Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an interview 
with the British Broadcasting Corp. that ``I think you could sum up 
our mood as one of qualified optimism.'' He said he spoke with Annan 
on Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.'' But Cook 
said Britain will not budge on the demand by Washington and London 
that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Annan said 
he was tired after arriving back in Jerba. He left Sunday for a summit 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Gulf states, 
which begins Monday in the United Arab Emirates. In Washington, James 
Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United States is awaiting 
a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied 
with U.N. Security Council resolutions. ``Compliance means turnover 
of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 
years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.'' 
State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison 
Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying 
Sunday that ``a solution to this crisis is within reach.'' Annan's 
meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news agency, 
JANA, initially reported that Annan might not be able to meet with 
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.'' U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's trip into the Libyan 
desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet with Gadhadi in a tent 
with a roaring fire outside. Earlier, Libyan media suggested that 
Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects _ an indication 
he was giving himself room in case he decides against giving up the 
two men wanted by the United States and Britain. JANA indicated a 
decision on handing over the two suspects would have to be approved 
by some 500 grassroots national committees before being considered 
by the Parliament. Libyan radio reported that the Parliament had been 
called to meet Tuesday in Sirte, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of 
Tripoli, but did not say whether the Lockerbie issue would be discussed. 
Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane from Jerba after receiving 
clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under 
U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects. 
The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but do 
not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. The Netherlands 
was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed a trial in a neutral country. 
But a disagreement has arisen because Libya wants the suspects jailed 
in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted, but the United States and 
Britain insist they be imprisoned in Scotland.
