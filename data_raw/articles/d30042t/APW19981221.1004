With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people 
of Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought 
Pan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday. 
The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in 
a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988. But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed 
throughout the century-old church as a few moments of silence were 
observed before the bagpiper blew her lament. ``In the lives that 
were lost, some very young, there was meaning and achievement,'' the 
Rev. David Almond told the gathering of about 600 people, which included 
60 family members of those who perished. ``Our task in commemoration 
is to continue that meaning and to build on that achievement.'' The 
congregation heard the children of the local elementary school sing 
a tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message from the queen. 
``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together 
in quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's message said. 
In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by Blair, 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second son of 
Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the names of the 
259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents were read out as 
a candle was lit for each. Simultaneous services were also held at 
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse, New York, 
which lost 35 college students in the crash. Each service began at 
7:03 p.m. (1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the 
radar screen above Scotland. ``This was a very positive, emotional 
day,'' Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas 
died in the crash, said after the service. He said the people of Lockerbie 
have ``proven over the past 10 years that good intentions can overcome 
evil.'' Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid 
a wreath in Lockerbie's cemetery, where the town's Roman Catholic 
parish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims' 
relatives and townspeople about the ``ticking bomb'' of justice. ``Ten 
years ago, for you and for us, a bomb was ticking,'' the Rev. Pat 
Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be assured of 
this _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible bomb of justice 
and truth. ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic 
gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice 
and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths are held 
accountable,'' he said. Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in 
connection with the bombing, but have not yet been turned over for 
trial. Last week, Libya's Parliament gave its conditional approval 
for a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court, but said some 
obstacles remained. The plane had just reached its cruising altitude 
of 31,000 feet (9,400 kms), 42 minutes after taking off from London's 
Heathrow Airport for New York, when it exploded in the night sky. 
The aircraft was felled by a small amount of high explosives smuggled 
on in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase, which made its way 
as checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London.
