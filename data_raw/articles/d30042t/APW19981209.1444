Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western 
politics when they go on trial. ``We want to be sure that the only 
aim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without 
a political or security background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim 
al-Zuwiy said. He was addressing the General People's Congress, or 
Parliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the 
two men who are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. 
A total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the 
jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Libya has accepted 
in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. 
But the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya's demand 
for a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in 
Libya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects 
serve their prison term in Britain. The Parliament meeting, expected 
to last five days, is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte 
and was broadcast live on national television. Libyan media have suggested 
that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to 
hand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approved 
by the Congress. ``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional 
trial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term 
in Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' al-Zuwiy said. He said Libya 
is seeking the guarantees from the West to ensure that the trial will 
be ``honest, just .. and without loopholes that (would) leave our 
citizens in illegal, unjust and inappropriate circumstances.'' Opening 
the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the background 
to the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanctions on 
Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspects for 
trial. The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, 
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment. 
Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspects will have the 
right to an appeal in the same court if it finds them guilty. On Saturday, 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the 
details. No agreement was reached but Annan said Libya is expected 
to reach a decision soon.
