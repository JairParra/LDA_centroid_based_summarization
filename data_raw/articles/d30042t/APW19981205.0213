TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in 
Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects 
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day 
visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports 
in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the 
suspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself 
enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the 
suspects. Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort 
island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee to make the flight. A Libyan official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said Annan had arrived in the country but refused to 
give details. Libyan media, controlled by the government, did not 
report on the visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity. 
It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats 
said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal 
town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the Libyan capital 
of Tripoli. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its 
refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They are accused by the United 
States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish 
village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 
747 and 11 people on ground were killed. A Libyan legal team has been 
meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British 
proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish 
law and using Scottish judges. Dutch authorities say they have made 
arrangements to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base 
near Utrecht. On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some 
good work on the Lockerbie dossier.'' ``We will try to resolve some 
problems and to find solutions together _ once and for all,'' Annan 
said. But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a 
decision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA said Friday 
that Gadhafi ``is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign 
minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution.'' ``As such, 
Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,'' the report said. 
JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects would 
have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees before 
being decided by the Parliament. The Netherlands was chosen as a venue 
for the trial after Libya itself proposed the trial be held in a third 
country. Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment 
of the suspects, if convicted. Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands 
or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned 
in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue. The U.N. sanctions 
on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. They 
ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales. Some Libyan 
assets abroad have also been frozen. But many African countries have 
defied the air ban and their leaders have flown in and out of Libya.
