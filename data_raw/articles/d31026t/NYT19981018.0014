Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as squeegee men 
a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both 
might be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season. 
Two big hits in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday 
night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 
5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run 
to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand 
slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory 
in the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee 
Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 
Sunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, 
the Yankees were able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, 
driving him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many as 
San Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again 
until Game 4, at the earliest. Brown was pitching with a three-run 
lead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged 
back-to-back homers. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada 
hit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown 
a whopping 64 pitches in the first three innings, went out, and the 
reliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees 
have done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle 
innings, before exploiting a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, 
had earned notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League 
Championship Series against Cleveland, standing and waiting for an 
interference call as the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the 
decisive run scored. The Yankees came back to win the series, however; 
Knoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience 
had helped him. Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch 
had to duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall 
had to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly 
down the left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. 
But it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, 
to see the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium 
shook. Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust 
both arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic 
weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He stomped 
around the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him happily. 
When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left the game, 
and Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter 
advanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. 
Chili Davis drew a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming 
to the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career 
at-bats in league championship and World Series games. With the count 
two balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch near the outside 
corner that he thought should have been a strike. Instead, Garcia 
called it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw. Langston 
and Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the 
bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players 
refer to as a cookie _ a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez ate 
up this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, 
lifting three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' 
first baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez from the 
dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arms, and later 
the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San 
Diego's lead was long gone. The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over 
Brown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the 
second. They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, 
the rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left 
fielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right 
field line with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some 
waving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed 
on the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees 
had the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best 
pitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning 
with a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio 
Veras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing 
Vaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls 
and two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to 
run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular 
season. Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the 
second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, 
the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, 
perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch 
Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada returned to the plate, 
called for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short 
and quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck 
golf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie 
game. Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before 
jamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on contact, 
but it was enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. 
Gwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats, and 
looked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner 
on first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of 
the infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and 
ripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck 
in right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, as 
Wells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball. He got one, 
delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the 
left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back 
home runs allowed by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and 
Yankee Stadium was silent. It would not stay that way.
