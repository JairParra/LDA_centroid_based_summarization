The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they 
were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the 
Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's 
not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they 
have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural 
progression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be 
in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement 
with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship 
series and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even 
though the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division 
series and the World Series. The three American League umpires who 
are on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of 
the playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and 
behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene 
Budig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, 
one of the league's ``most respected umpires.'' But after Saturday 
night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now 
why does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right 
field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at 
Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship 
series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; 
he has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught 
Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, 
prepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a 
home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly 
showing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the 
first game and set the tone for the series. ``Even though he made 
a mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge comes 
as small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that 
umpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect. ``Major league 
umpires are skilled at what they do, but they are human,'' he said 
in a telephone interview. ``Day in and day out they do a very good 
job for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, 
but that happens from time to time.'' The umpires were so human in 
the American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to 
time to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility 
of the umpires. ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked 
down by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' 
final game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game 
for us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series 
with umpires.'' In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the 
plate umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the 
plate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting 
of Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, 
and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry 
was right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall 
of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the 
ALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In 
Game 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target 
throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get 
out of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field. A batted 
ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6. But the 
worst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at second base. 
Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came 
off the base before he caught the ball. Members of the Yankees indicated 
Friday that they, too, thought the call was wrong. ``I don't know,'' 
Williams said when asked what he thought, ``but I'll take it. It was 
a big play.'' But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment 
about that,'' he said. ``It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't 
want to get into that.'' When a player believes he was safe, he says 
so and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams 
was implying that he thought he was out, another member of the Yankees 
said he had no doubt that Williams was out. ``I wasn't sure at first,'' 
this uniformed member of the team said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, 
I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't 
come off the bag. Then I saw the replay. He was out.'' The game today 
is faster than it used to be, this observer said. The umpires have 
to be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American 
League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the 
National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine 
in these four to seven games. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said 
he thought his umpires were first-rate in the division and league 
series and added that he has ``three splendid umpires'' working the 
World Series. Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. 
We have total confidence in them.'' The umpires should let the players 
make the errors and the managers the bad decisions. Then everyone 
will talk about the players and managers and not the umpires.
