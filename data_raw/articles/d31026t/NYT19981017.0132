A new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he 
massaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on 
the barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly 
again and again. Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he 
reacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for 
the first time. ``You were saving the World Series trees until now, 
right?'' Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. 
``These are from World Series trees, aren't they?'' Martinez could 
joke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series 
because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past 
three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 
at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who were watching 
on television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World 
Series wood. Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats 
during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still 
alive for the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the 
power hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around. 
For now. ``You always get a fresh start in the post-season because 
it's game to game,'' said Martinez. ``If you win, you've got another 
game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easier 
to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest 
at-bat of the season.'' Normally, having Martinez at the plate for 
the biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the 
Yankees. But not when the calendar flips to October. Martinez has 
experienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 
strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved 
team that has batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games 
because of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, 
their most valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter? ``We've 
just gotten through two good series,'' said Paul O'Neill. ``The Yankees 
won those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. 
The whole team won.'' As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing 
one line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman 
is in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining the Yankees, 
Martinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season 
games. Those are puny statistics, especially for a player who has 
driven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three 
years. ``I would guess that Tino would have a great series,'' O'Neill 
said. ``Baseball has a way of evening things out. You have a bad series, 
you come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easier 
to do. In the post-season, it gets tougher.'' It cannot get much tougher 
for Martinez, who was dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during 
the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians 
and will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez has blamed 
his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. 
He has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of 
3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that 
his previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue 
the obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez has 
already made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in 
his last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch 
and 4 walks. It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it 
is something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez 
had to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him 
in 30 of 34 career at-bats. ``If I was getting good pitches and missing 
them, then I'd say I have a bad swing working,'' said Martinez. ``But 
I've been swinging at bad pitches. Right now, I've just got to be 
patient and wait.'' The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. 
In the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez 
at first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It was a difficult decision because 
Martinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the 
Yankees until July 31. But the Yankees grabbed all three games so 
it worked. Torre does not have such an attractive replacement this 
season in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better 
or worse, while he tries to stay positive and finally produce. ``It's 
the World Series,'' said Martinez. ``You got to go out there and have 
fun with it. Big games are all big games. You want to go out there 
and enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You 
don't think that you might lose that day.''
