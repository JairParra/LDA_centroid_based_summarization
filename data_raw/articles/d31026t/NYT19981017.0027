YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance 
past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells 
is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional 
edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against 
left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, 
pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and 
earned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit 
from six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being 
able to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff 
might be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues 
to be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic 
Andy Pettitte, who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches 
low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief 
outing. Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming 
out of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, 
Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through 
the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius 
has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees 
do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the 
fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason 
funk is a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge 
Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive 
pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense 
The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle 
with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really 
taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center 
field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn 
will try. The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers 
have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third 
base. Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly 
Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams 
can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against 
Kevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive 
against Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim 
Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San 
Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the 
moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken 
Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran 
team capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base 
and then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional 
pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff 
hitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become 
more pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at 
the right field stands in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be 
a factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him 
from leaning over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher 
in this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should 
Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. 
But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy 
Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the 
corners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command 
is suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball 
to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two 
rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause 
him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect 
of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side 
(the stuff of each has waned). But if a lead can be delivered into 
the hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly 
catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. 
Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning 
double plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; 
Wally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley 
is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball 
to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field 
line, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will 
be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras 
can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as 
well. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though 
Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't 
make mistakes on the bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: 
A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch 
him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, 
jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: 
A left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball. Left-handers like 
David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside. Tony 
Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, 
he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking 
balls out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything 
high and over the plate. Because he likes to pull the ball, you must 
pitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him 
honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed. 
These days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs 
up in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump 
on a fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be 
jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes to hit pitches inside 
out, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power 
if you make a mistake with a breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient 
hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: 
Looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike 
zone. Can struggle against breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent 
holes right now, can hit fastballs in and away. Best bet is to get 
ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls. PITCHING 
TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with 
fastballs because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets 
hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches 
at his feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer 
the ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure 
hitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away, particularly 
after there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has 
trouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When he lays off them, he 
is a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland 
series. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep 
into a count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt. 
Cheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to off-speed 
pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious 
and chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in 
the count, and isn't taking advantage of mistakes when they're made. 
Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also drive 
a fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's Charles 
Nagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very 
poorly against splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like 
all young hitters, he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and 
chase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count. 
Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS 
Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam 
fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that 
breaks down and away from right-handed batters, and a forkball that 
dives at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, 
aggressive, challenging hitters with fastballs. His curveball can 
be exceptional, and his changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed 
as many home runs (29) as walks (29), but has not allowed a three-run 
homer or a grand slam all year.
