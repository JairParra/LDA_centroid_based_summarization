Talk about high expectations. It's not just the man from Tampa who 
has them anymore. Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody 
in the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series 
and the league championship series as just so much parsley on the 
plate of life. ``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so 
I can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying 
before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it 
San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Now that the Yankees 
are in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they 
themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. 
Anything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the 
Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off 
the bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other 
cities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and 
the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. 
The three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into 
football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one 
exalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers, 
condemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking them in 
their sore spots for eternity. The World Series used to be a short 
and sweet reward for excellence, but that was when there were eight 
teams per league, and the winners met in daylight in early October. 
Even if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission 
once again, well, there was always next year. But in 1969, baseball 
began league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered 
playoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why 
we should all resist the babble of ``post-season records'' flung at 
us by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from 
the dozens of different networks that carry baseball. The World Series 
is still a competition between one league that encourages pitchers 
to be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow 
the ``playoffs'' leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. Think 
about it. The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot 
perform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because 
they had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee 
pitching when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of winning a special 
playoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been 
pre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern 
title held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh 
and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking of indignity, 
there are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs 
is merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the 
team of the '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is up 
to management to keep repeating that: ``The main goal is to get to 
the Series. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. 
This is a recorded announcement.'' In Cleveland, the fans had to live 
with the phrase ``Nineteen forty-eight!'' being chanted at the Indians 
in the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leaves 
the Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can 
be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on 
the 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: ``A lot of the players 
on that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little 
different attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World 
Series.' And this year, I think you will see the players out there 
playing to win.'' Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he 
said his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. ``I am sure that 
is the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't 
predicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,'' 
Torre said. ``I think getting here is where the pressure is,'' Torre 
added. ``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough 
after playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having 
to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here.'' Torre 
continued: ``You don't think about in spring training that we want 
to go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. 
Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough 
games, then of course, we want to win. ``As far as legitimizing our 
season _ I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego 
happens to win the World Series, sure it takes a little bit of the 
luster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think 
that was our goal, initially.'' The key word in that sentence is ``initially.'' 
The Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World 
Series tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees 
had better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own excellence.
