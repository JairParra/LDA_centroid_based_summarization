The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the 
first inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the 
first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball 
last Wednesday. There were no boos. It was a very warm ovation. They 
liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had 
emphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and 
rumbling into the World Series, not about the fans. But it surely 
made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven 
him. Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch 
and he could play second base without earplugs. When the Yankees defeated 
the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second 
World Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved 
player on the field. The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 
would be forgotten. The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch 
was celebrating as much as anyone. ``To have them act like that toward 
me was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. 
``It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out.'' Knoblauch 
was wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American 
League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke. He did 
not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot 
by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are 
expected not to make. ``Just to face things and take it like a man 
and answer all the questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch 
said. ``You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from 
something like that. That's basically what I learned.'' If the Yankees 
had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that 
he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball 
that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside 
the baseline. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead 
run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can 
watch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy. 
``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said. ``That's huge for me. I 
let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one 
if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's 
feeling a lot better now.'' Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, 
was working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters 
were allowed into the clubhouse. He flashed the sort of smile that 
he had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in 
the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about 
his mistake. ``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek 
Jeter said. ``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something 
good.''
