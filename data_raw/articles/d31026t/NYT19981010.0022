A strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came 
Friday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their heads for a radio 
promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets 
for post-season play. ``This was more a show of support for the team 
than it was for the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the 
``Jeff and Jer'' show. ``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald 
Padres _ Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About 
a thousand people showed up _ men, women and children. We had 10 barbers 
and 20 hairdressers and it took six hours for the lines to either 
get buzzed or straight-razored. ``We were shocked at the turnout. 
But this is a bandwagon town. `Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' 
type public. You'll see an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've 
won and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series.'' 
After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League 
Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game 
lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing 
up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would 
be the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the 
downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read ``Go 
Padres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by several hundred fans. 
The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a 
half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three 
years ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres 
owner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment 
in the park after they bought the team in December 1994. ``This is 
a more diversified group of fans than I saw in Atlanta,'' Lucchino 
said. ``Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud of our three generations 
of families who come to the games.'' Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old 
homemaker from La Jolla, has been a fan since she was 10 and the Pacific 
Coast League Padres played at Lane Field near the harbor. She would 
take a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy 
bleacher seats. Later, she brought her four children to Jack Murphy 
Stadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd. 
Now, she brings her grandchildren to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. 
``There are different groups in the stands,'' she said, ``the upper 
class, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, 
the children, all of the Mexican fans from across the border. We are 
true fans _ all of us.'' San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while 
also giving credit to the balmy weather. ``Padre fans are a cross-section 
from all over the county,'' she said. ``Downtown, suburban, rural, 
east, north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies 
to the new kids _ the X generation. A lot from across the border. 
The Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect 
weather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in 
October has got to be better than in New York.'' Carlos Carrion, who 
was born in San Diego and has been a baseball fan for 25 years, brings 
his 10- and 8-year-old sons to the stadium. ``This is a great chance 
to let my children see the players work,'' Carrion said. ``They can 
look up to these guys and understand their character and their work 
ethic.'' The Padres ticket office estimates that on average, more 
than 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from 
San Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have 
the first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana.
