Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian 
Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with 
his two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken 
and potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., 
instead of in a hospital. ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, 
in a telephone interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and 
to just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.'' 
Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon 
on Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 
days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old 
outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound 
frame, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the 
World Series games and is content watching his teammates play the 
Padres on television. ``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, 
who spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship. 
``I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking 
forward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.'' Paul 
O'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, ``Everything 
we're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some 
good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him.'' 
Since cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed 
from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told 
him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns 
to California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he 
will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. ``I was never 
scared,'' said Strawberry. ``I was more emotional than anything. At 
the time of it, I had played for a while with this. I wanted to keep 
playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.'' 
At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the 
Yankees had made it to the World Series as he expected. ``I wanted 
to be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry. ``I 
don't think that I was ever scared. It's something that I wanted to 
deal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo. He said 
it's not as bad as some people say.'' Although the discovery of cancer 
in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained 
optimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me. I got 
all the information from the doctors. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't 
spreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.'' When 
Strawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, 
a few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl, Darryl.'' 
Strawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thanked 
everyone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully 
entered a car. ``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry 
said. ``But it has.'' Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter 
in the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres 
in five games, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether 
he will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, 
who is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very 
confident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the 
back of their caps as inspiration. ``They look really good,'' said 
Strawberry.'' It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready. 
The best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you 
don't have to go anywhere else after that. You've made it to that 
point and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all 
about.''
