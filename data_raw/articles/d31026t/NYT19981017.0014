The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is 
fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude 
with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the 
aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting 
and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its 
aura of history and accomplishment. That makes it the perfect venue 
for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 
1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just 
a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World 
Series. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter 
of the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem 
to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The 
word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't 
measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers 
in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers 
in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn 
and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that 
a match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, 
Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower 
Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the 
truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball 
fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home 
team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that 
sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning 
the World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful 
at the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top 
run producer, has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American 
League batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland 
Indians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane Spencer, 
the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be 
the new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since August. The 
curious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular 
season than any team in American League history, is how quiet and 
unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering 
clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. So when 
the Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team 
might simply fade away. Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead 
in the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency 
all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade 
up Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday 
night will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season, 
an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one 
that is remembered.
