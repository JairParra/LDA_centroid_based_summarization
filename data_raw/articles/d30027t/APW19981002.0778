President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit 
Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would 
be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman 
said Friday. ``The president clearly understands that such a ban would 
be a clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to 
the Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushin. The remarks came after media reports of a government economic 
plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars 
and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic 
controls, rolling back seven years of reforms. Though government officials 
say such a plan is only one of six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' 
measures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the 
next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International 
Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations 
with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials 
have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound 
economic program before the loan is given, and have made it clear 
that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles 
are not acceptable. But Primakov said that the country's plan would 
be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. No short-term 
economic plan will be known for another three weeks, long after the 
IMF is set to make its decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister 
Vadim Gustov. A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget 
would rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said. 
Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major deficit 
spending. Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted 
by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press 
_ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew 
heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of 
banning foreign currency sales ``a mad idea.'' Meanwhile, Russia's 
stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading was 
so light the downward move meant little. The stock market has continued 
to fall since the crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection was down 
in September, the result of the collapse in Russia's banking system, 
said Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit 
department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 
700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less than expected. The government 
wants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for oil and gas companies, 
but the idea is expected to meet sharp resistance in the lower house 
of Russia's parliament, which wants to cut tax rates, Pochinok said.
