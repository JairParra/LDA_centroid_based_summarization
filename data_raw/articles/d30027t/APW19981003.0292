Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis 
would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing 
state property. ``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of 
production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness 
through renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of 
Western businessmen. ``We shall conduct privatization so that it serves 
the interests of the people, the state, and business,'' he said, according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured the businessmen, 
members of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment 
in Russia, that the government had no plans to ban the circulation 
of U.S. dollars in Russia. But, he said, the government would take 
steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia. Responding to media 
reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians 
from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said 
the reports ``absolutely do not correspond to reality,'' ITAR-Tass 
quoted him as saying. He said there was no need to regulate the influx 
of dollars into Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent 
what he called ``the dollar drain.'' Russian companies stashed about 
dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax 
news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov 
said foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help Russia to 
minimize its losses from the current economic crisis. ``We are very 
much interested in foreign investments, especially in ones that go 
into the real production sector,'' Primakov said, according to Interfax. 
``We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors, without whom 
it will be difficult for us to overcome the current difficulties.'' 
He said Russia wanted long-term investments. ``Foreign capital has 
been coming to the country via short-term operations,'' Primakov said. 
This, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.'' Viktor Gerashchenko, 
the central bank chairman, said on Friday that the government must 
act to stem the flow of dollars from Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in Washington Saturday for the annual 
meeting of the International Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell 
out the measures Russia is taking to bail out its finance system. 
Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment 
of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the country's 
economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign 
loans. IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to 
come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, 
and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money 
supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.
