Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid 
Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for 
savings lost in banks. Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised 
version of the decree and debate it later in the month. They must 
consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect 
under the constitution. Leftist factions, which voted against the 
proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return 
of savings lost during the financial instability that has recently 
hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated 
money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case 
the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. 
Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting 
only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors 
said it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their 
money in banks. The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals 
of deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as 
people, scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil 
in neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and household 
goods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn 
at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they 
deposited in banks.
