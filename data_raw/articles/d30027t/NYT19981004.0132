If the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been planning for 
months _ millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday 
for some of the biggest demonstrations in years. But now that Communists 
or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the 
country and its economy the question is what the marchers will be 
demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers 
were easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of 
himself today, and his advisers are gone. The Communists, who have 
undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working 
hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help 
run _ and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin 
and his policies. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because 
discontent over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support 
for his predecessors. An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi 
Zyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called the new government 
bourgeois. The characterization was striking, because the new prime 
minister, Yevgeny Primakov, was one of Zyuganov's top choices for 
the post. The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri 
Maslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the 
infamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union 
to ruin. ``We don't have slogans that are aimed against the government,'' 
the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander 
Kuvayev, said in a recent interview. ``All the slogans are aimed against 
the president and the economic course of the country. Only the president 
can fully be blamed for the course that has brought the country to 
this situation.'' Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing 
some Russians back to Soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility 
toward capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya 
Rossiya devoted most of its front page on Thursday to what it said 
were the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans. The 
entries ranged from catchy to kitschy, from, ``Legislator, official, 
banker _ study the Constitution; the exam is Oct. 7,'' to, `` Imperialist! 
Help Russia return the exported capital, and we will pay the debts 
at once.'' Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic 
chaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy. 
There is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will produce 
huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and 
political analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said the situation 
was not unlike that of 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular 
mandate in a referendum. He used it to dissolve the Communist-dominated 
Parliament and increase his own power. That led to an autumn showdown, 
the shelling of Parliament by tanks and the total defeat, for the 
time being, of Yeltsin's legislative opponents. ``You can interpret 
this demonstration as a Communist mandate, but I don't think they 
will act like Yeltsin,'' Ms. Lipman said. ``Support for the Communists 
is at its smallest level, maybe 20 percent.'' In a survey of 1,714 
people that was released last week the All-Russian Public Opinion 
Center said that nearly half the population supported the idea of 
demonstrations against Yeltsin, but that barely one-tenth were likely 
to participate in any way. ``Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle,'' 
Yuri Levada, who heads the center, said in an interview. ``This is 
mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities, 
mainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sins.'' 
There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort. 
Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary 
of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over 
the Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent 
Russian Unions, a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor 
of the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate 
on Wednesday. The government has vowed to keep order without resorting 
to force. But it is concerned enough that it has summoned 11,000 police 
officers to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops to intervene if 
violence erupts. Protests since 1993 have generally been tepid, a 
deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less 
practice runs, hinted at similarly dampened marches this year.
