The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within 
the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia 
about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive 
review of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime 
minister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' 
about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would 
soon abate. ``We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing 
new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and 
restoring state management of parts of the economy,'' she told the 
U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. ``We can only wonder if some 
members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the 
global economy.'' While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when 
he was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key 
issues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him. ``Our 
initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been 
particularly positive,'' she said, adding, ``The question now is whether 
that cooperation can continue.'' The United States must keep up its 
aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy 
and student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. Washington 
does not favor more direct aid. ``More big bailouts are not by themselves 
going to restore investor confidence in Russia,'' she said. ``In the 
long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be 
met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.'' Albright 
sharply criticized as self-defeating the ``many voices in Russia who 
want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and 
our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition 
and defiance for its own stake.'' Russia could not stand alone in 
the world, she said, and the United States' ability ``to help Russians 
help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to 
being absolutely impossible.'' At the same time, she said, Washington 
would not ``assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people 
in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock.'' And she 
urged the world _ and American critics _ to ``be patient with the 
workings of the democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each 
day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that 
American officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin 
dismissed the previous government. While Moscow may continue to oppose 
any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province 
of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless.
