Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of 
one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate 
whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated. President 
Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation 
into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday 
night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. An aide was also 
shot and critically wounded. The shooting occurred in a building along 
St. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious 
Russian crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 
19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.'' Like that fictional 
crime, which shone a light on social ferment in the St. Petersburg 
of its day, the death of Starovoitova was immediately seized upon 
as a seminal event in the Russia of the late 1990s. ``It is one of 
the black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir Putin, director 
of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the Interfax news agency. 
``It doesn't do much to improve our reputation, the reputation of 
the country as a whole.'' Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy 
in the lower house of parliament who inspired strong feelings from 
both her friends and enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic 
Choice party, she was planning to run for president in 2000. Those 
close to her speculated about who might have wanted her dead, with 
some naming various prominent politicians as potential culprits. ``Whose 
path did she cross? The answer is simple: communists and gangsters,'' 
said former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. ``These are the 
two kinds of people in whose way she was standing.'' Putin, whose 
agency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned that there was 
still no evidence that her death was a political assassination. Interior 
Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the motive for the 
crime, but told reporters that it was being investigated under a criminal 
code section that covers terrorism. Arriving at the St. Petersburg 
airport from Moscow, he said: ``I brought with me a team of experienced 
investigators. I think we will clear it up soon.'' Yeltsin sent a 
telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, 
the State Duma, promising that the ``contractors and executors of 
the murder will be found and severely punished,'' The president also 
sent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in which he called her ``one 
of the most vivid figures in Russian politics,'' who ``consistently 
upheld the lofty ideals of freedom and democracy.'' More than 200 
people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova. 
People hugged quietly as they listened to speeches by her fellow politicians 
and friends. The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations 
and photographs of the deputy with various people, including the late 
Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov. ``We are united 
today by pain, which is bigger than politics,'' said Viktor Krivulin, 
a poet and candidate for the regional legislature. ``Politics, as 
I felt during the past night, has become the art of spitting on the 
soul.'' Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova 
was killed by those who disliked her outspoken views. ``She had too 
many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. She 
said Starovoitova had received many threats in the past. ``It was 
doubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov, the chairman 
of the Young Christian Democrats. Police said two men followed Starovoitova 
and her aide, Ruslan Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her 
building Friday evening. Linkov was shot twice. He regained consciousness 
after a five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained 
in critical condition in intensive care. A pistol with a silencer 
and and automatic rifle were found at the scene, ITAR-Tass said. A 
funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of Gorelovo, near 
St. Petersburg.
