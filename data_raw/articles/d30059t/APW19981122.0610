In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane. Two thugs, 
armed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful 
figure, then slipped away into the night. Police vowed to catch them 
and politicians expressed outrage. Usually, that would be the end 
of the story. This time, though, the figure shot was one of the most 
prominent and popular women in Russian politics, a prospective presidential 
candidate with friends in the highest reaches of the Kremlin. As outrage 
mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova 
was not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might 
turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. ``This is impossible 
to tolerate any longer,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, 
another reform-oriented party. ``We must stop feeling powerless before 
the increasingly cheeky scum. We cannot go on living as though everything 
is running as usual.'' Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a 
leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking 
up the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young 
aide Friday evening. A team of assailants _ police believe it was 
a man and a woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire. Starovoitova, 
shot three times in the head, collapsed and died instantly, authorities 
said. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded, 
but managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness. 
Police have recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can provide 
a description of the killers. He had regained consciousness but still 
could not speak Sunday. Although it was still not clear who killed 
Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract 
hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of the 
killings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped 
the government and the economy. Until now, the most notorious of the 
killings was that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who 
was shot outside his Moscow home in 1995. But there have been hundreds 
of others. St. Petersburg has been especially plagued. Last year, 
the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a central St. Petersburg 
street. In the past two months alone, hitmen have claimed the lives 
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent 
banker. So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President 
Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that 
his Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _ 
had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent 
businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
There is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination 
of Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order was the equivalent of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton ordering an investigation into whether the FBI was plotting 
to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Yet, as remarkable as that 
news was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. 
Television news since her death has carried reports of little else. 
Reaction has poured in from virtually every important figure in the 
country, and from surrounding nations. Yeltsin, calling her ``my comrade,'' 
declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her 
death. There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, 
the sense that a line had been crossed. Perhaps it was because she 
was a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or 
perhaps because people are simply fed up. But, in more characteristic 
fashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing. 
Colleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence 
_ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, 
were the most likely culprits in her death. Historian Dmitry Likachyov, 
one of the nation's most revered and trusted figures, said her killing 
seemed to signal the ``outburst of a new Red Terror.'' By late Saturday, 
the name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin 
called a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist 
speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. 
Seleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her death. 
``But,'' he added, ``I would not like the deputies who sat on the 
same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma ... to turn 
this into a political show.'' It is too early to know where the recriminations 
and political maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain 
is the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian 
martyrs.
