The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian 
reform movement has produced few leaders with an uncompromising dedication 
to democracy. Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg 
on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia. In a bleak season of economic 
collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears 
that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political 
violence. Initial evidence suggests that the killing was a political 
assassination. Ms. Starovoitova was gunned down in the lobby of her 
apartment building, shot three times in the head, typical of Russian 
contract killings. She was a member of the Russian parliament and 
a recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. 
Petersburg. In recent weeks she had spoken out forcefully against 
political extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic statements of a Communist 
parliamentarian and was campaigning aggressively against financial 
corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government. Ms. Starovoitova's 
activities were fully in character with a career built around principles 
of liberty, tolerance and the rule of law. She championed democracy 
and human rights long before they became politically acceptable in 
Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers 
as Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet 
Union disintegrated. An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova 
proved to be a skillful and effective politician. She first gained 
national attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work 
about the ethnic history of Leningrad and ran successfully for a seat 
in the Soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a Russian. 
She later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature. Ms. 
Starovoitova was a woman of irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm. 
But her good humor and quick smile belied a steely commitment to combat 
the corruption and ethnic divisions that she correctly considered 
to be the enemies of Russian democracy. The least Yeltsin can do is 
to hunt down her killers and bring them to trial. That would be the 
exception in a nation where political violence is rarely prosecuted. 
Her countrymen can honor her memory by following her example.
