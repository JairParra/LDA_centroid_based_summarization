A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next 
elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. 
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament 
from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment 
building along with her aide, the Interfax news agency reported. It 
gave no other details. Starovoitova tried to run for president in 
the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical 
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. There have been 
several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.
