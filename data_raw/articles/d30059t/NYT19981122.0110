Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house 
on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, 
was shot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, 
Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness 
in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with gunshot 
wounds to the head and neck. The police say the two were attacked 
in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, 
one of them a young woman. The attackers reportedly fled through a 
back entrance to a waiting car. Two guns were found at the scene. 
Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's 
democratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for 
the killing remains unclear. ``The choice of the target suggests a 
well-thought out plan,'' said Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the 
Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. 
``To kill a woman _ a woman in politics _ that has not happened in 
Russia since Stalin's time.'' Setting aside past feuds, local democratic 
groups said Sunday that they would unite in coming elections to the 
St. Petersburg city council, combining their forces against what they 
say are criminals who have invaded local politics. At a gathering 
Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister 
and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly rejected suggestions 
that Russia should adopt extraordinary security measures to stem the 
rise in political crime.
