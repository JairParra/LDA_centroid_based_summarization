A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next 
elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. 
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament 
from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment 
building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency 
reported. Linkov was seriously injured, it said. The report gave no 
other details. A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment 
on the report. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 
1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical 
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served as President 
Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights 
committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains 
city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and 
later received a doctorate in history. She was divorced and had one 
son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attacks 
on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official 
was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, 
and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last 
month.
