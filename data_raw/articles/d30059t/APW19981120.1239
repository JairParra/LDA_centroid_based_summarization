A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next 
elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. 
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament 
from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry 
way of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor found the body 
in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance, they 
said. The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also 
seriously injured. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in 
the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical 
reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served as President 
Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights 
committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains 
city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and 
later received a doctorate in history. She was divorced and had one 
son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attacks 
on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official 
was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, 
and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last 
month.
