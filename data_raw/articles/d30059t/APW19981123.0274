A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness 
Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects 
in raids around the city, officials said. Galina Starovoitova, 52, 
a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot 
dead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building 
in St. Petersburg on Friday night. The killing of such a prominent 
politician has caused an uproar in Russia and prompted calls from 
all sides for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness. Scores 
of business leaders and others have been gunned down in recent years 
in contract killings that are almost never solved. The lawmaker's 
aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a ``clear'' mind Monday, testifying 
to investigators, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Special police 
armed with assault rifles were standing guard at the door of his hospital 
room. Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raids 
and rounded up several suspects, officials said. There were no further 
details. Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack 
and later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the 
weekend. Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ 
that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of 
parliament, were the most likely culprits. Over the weekend, Interior 
Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say 
there was no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady 
Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. Seleznyov responded in kind 
on Monday, suggesting that the ``extremists from democratic organizations'' 
might have staged the murder in order to win local elections set for 
Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported. The speaker also threatened 
to file a libel suit against a St. Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova 
edited. The newspaper recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an 
illegal fund to finance a presidential bid and other shady activities. 
Seleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000, denied 
the newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an ``outright 
slander.'' Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract 
murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady 
Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's killing as an occasion to lambast 
the government for its inability to contain soaring crime. ``That's 
a result of the (government's) catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction 
of the state and the nation,'' he said. Starovoitova, of the reformist 
party Democratic Russia, tried to run for president in 1996 but her 
registration was turned down for technical reasons. She had said she 
would run again in 2000. She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide 
on ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle 
_ and later joined the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal 
defenders of liberal reforms. Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' 
and said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing. 
Starovoitova remarried earlier this year and had one son and a grandson. 
She is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye cemetery 
in St. Petersburg.
