A slain Russian lawmaker was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic 
ideals in a stately funeral service in which anger mingled freely 
with tears. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside 
some of Russia's greatest national heroes. The stirring tribute to 
Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, was 
indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death. ``To stop 
us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed,'' former Deputy 
Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral for Starovoitova. 
``We will fulfill the goals she sacrificed her life for.'' Hundreds 
of people, including many of the country's most prominent political 
figures, packed the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography 
Museum for the funeral. An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons 
and flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. 
At the end of the service, mourners passed grimly past it as classical 
music played. Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the 
cold, waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay 
their respects. ``Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make 
sure this never happens again,'' said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the 
manager of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, ``There's 
little hope of that in our country.'' Among speakers at the service 
were former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President 
Boris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff, who represented the president 
at the service. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko was also present. 
Yeltsin, who has said he will personally oversee the investigation 
into Starovoitova's killing, was in a Moscow hospital, recovering 
from pneumonia. ``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson 
for the whole of Russia,'' Yarov said. ``Irrespective of real motives 
for that murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and 
society should know all the truth about it.'' One national television 
channel turned over its daylong programming to funeral coverage and 
a memorial tribute. Newspapers carried page after page of coverage 
of her death. Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called 
on all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes 
at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Starovoitova was initially going to be buried in 
a simple cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family lives. 
But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government announced 
that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the 
city's center following the funeral at the Ethnography Museum. Among 
those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the composers Peter 
Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky. 
Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled 
the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide, 27-year-old 
Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded, but has been able to provide 
some description of the shooting to police. Acting on his information, 
investigators rounded up several suspects, officials said Monday. 
But a detective later said that investigators had learned nothing 
``serious'' from Linkov, according to the Interfax news agency, and 
there were no further details about whether the suspects were still 
in custody. Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior 
Ministry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he was confident the case 
would be solved. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that investigators 
``have tips, they have something to work on.'' Authorities are acting 
on the assumption that Starovoitova's death was a contract hit, a 
common event in post-Soviet Russia. Russian politicians and newspapers 
have speculated wildly about political motives for the killing, but 
police have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her 
dead. Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member 
of the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No 
one was hurt. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to 
Starovoitova's death.
