Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts 
of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era 
president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who helped 
negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and 
shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for 
that work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he was 
``an accessory after the fact'' in the bombings of the headquarters 
of a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s. The chairman 
of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although 
he took such action with ``great reluctance,'' the commission needed 
time to prepare to fight the legal challenge. He said it would take 
de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delaying its release 
Thursday. ``It upsets me deeply,'' he said in a statement. ``We have 
been scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that 
we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.'' De Klerk's challenge 
was only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leaks about the 
report in the last few days. Within hours of the commission decision 
to withdraw its findings on de Klerk, it was facing the possibility 
of a new suit _ this time from the ruling African National Congress. 
The ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its conduct 
during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, 
said the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the 
report is officially handed over to Mandela. While the commission's 
report is expected to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government 
for atrocities, it has also found the ANC responsible for human-rights 
violations, including the torture and killing of spying suspects, 
bombings in civilian areas and the killing of political enemies, including 
members of the rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision 
on de Klerk seems certain to damage the commission's credibility. 
The panel, created as a way of putting South Africa's brutal past 
to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials, 
has caused controversy from the start. It has held more than 160 hearings 
throughout the country, listening to both victims and to perpetrators 
seeking amnesty. But many whites say the commission is on a witch 
hunt aiming to humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners 
in general. De Klerk has once before forced the commission officials 
to court and won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some 
political analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the 
belief that the panel lacks impartiality. ``The withdrawal of the 
findings can't help but be seen as a lack of certainty on their side,'' 
said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the 
University of Stellenbosch, who has supported the commission. ``Whether 
we like it or not, the whole report gets a knock from this.'' De Klerk's 
spokesman, David Steward, said the former president ``was very confident'' 
that he would win when the case goes to trial in March. ``He is very 
happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission,'' 
Steward said. ``The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the 
definite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve 
Mr. de Klerk in a negative finding.'' The ANC has accused the commission 
of trying to ``criminalize'' the liberation struggle. ``Whatever the 
efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it as a gross violation 
of human rights,'' the congress said in a statement. ``The ANC and 
the millions of people who were part of this struggle will always 
be proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction 
of a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of 
struggle on the basis that the means justified the end.'' There are 
probably few subjects that get South Africans more excited than the 
issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or 
a waste of money. The events of the last few days have only added 
to the debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of 
the ANC's armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum 
are in an uproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone is 
complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' he 
said. But others say that too many questions are being raised about 
the panel's competence. ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery 
of justice,'' said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich 
farmer who believes that the commission has been a theatrical act. 
``We should all turn our backs on the past and move forward. We need 
them and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic 
conditions prevail.'' The commission's report is supposed to be a 
broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, 
from 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races ended white minority 
rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual 
prosecutions. While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging 
the commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges 
had led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than 
originally planned. Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified 
that they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 
15 successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be 
reached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. The commission 
is required by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends 
to implicate in its report. The commission had been expected to say 
that although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently 
came to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police 
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to 
report his knowledge to the police. This could open him up to a criminal 
prosecution. De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or 
any other. de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, 
Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for 
amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter.
