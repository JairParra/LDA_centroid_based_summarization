Following are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On 
the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of 
the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations 
of human rights was committed by the former state through its security 
and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, the South African state in 
the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in 
activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly 
planned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful 
acts, including the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and 
others, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful 
activities, the state acted in collusion with certain other political 
groupings, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . . 
Certain members of the State Security Council (the state President, 
Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and heads of security 
forces) did foresee that the use of words such as ``take out,'' ``wipe 
out,'' ``eradicate,'' and ``eliminate'' would result in the killing 
of political opponents. They are therefore responsible for deliberate 
planning which caused gross violations of human rights. P.W. BOTHA 
During the period that he presided as head of state (1978-1989) according 
to submissions made to and findings made by the Commission, gross 
violations of human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated 
on a wide scale by members of the South African Defense Force, including: 
The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons opposed 
to the policies of the Government, within and outside South Africa. 
The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment 
against such persons. The forcible abduction of such persons where 
were resident in neighboring countries. Covert logistical and financial 
assistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. 
and other liberation movements. . . . INKATHA The Commission finds 
that in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired 
with Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary 
unit (or ``hit squad'') to be deployed illegally against persons and 
organizations perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government 
and Inkatha. The S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical 
management and behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who 
were trained by the Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi 
Strip. The Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the 
paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human rights, 
including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment. The 
Commission finds the following people, among others, accountable for 
such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. . . . The A.N.C. While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss 
of civilian life should be ``avoided,'' there were instances where 
members of its security forces perpetrated gross violations of human 
rights in that the distinction between military and civilian targets 
was blurred in certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street 
bombing of the South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the 
course of the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces, 
undertook military operations which, though intended for military 
or security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety of reasons, 
including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequences in 
these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, 
were gross violations of human rights in respect of the injuries to 
and loss of lives of civilians. Individuals who defected to the state 
and became informers and/or members who became state witnesses in 
political trials . . . were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators 
and regarded as legitimate targets to be killed. The commission does 
not condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets 
and finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constituted 
gross violations of human rights. The commission finds that, in the 
1980's in particular, a number of gross violations were perpetrated 
not by direct members of the A.N.C. or those operating under its formal 
command, but by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. 
In this regard, the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and 
politically accountable for creating a climate in which such supporters 
believed their actions to be legitimate and carried out within the 
broad parameters of a ``people's war'' as enunciated by the A.N.C. 
A.N.C. CAMPS The Commission finds that suspected ``agents'' were routinely 
subjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and that 
there were cases of such individuals being charged and convicted by 
tribunals without proper regard to due process, sentenced to death 
and executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission finds that 
Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was central to the establishment and formation 
of the Mandela United Football Club, which later developed into a 
private vigilante unit. It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela 
was aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the 
community, but chose deliberately not to address the problems emanating 
from the football club. The Commission finds that those who opposed 
Ms. Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissented 
from them, were branded as informers and killed. The Commission finds 
that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable, politically and 
morally for the gross violations of human rights committed by the 
Mandela United Football Club. The Commission finds further that Mrs. 
Madikizela-Mandela herself was responsible for committing such gross 
violations of human rights. . . . BUSINESS Business was central to 
the economy that sustained the South African state during the apartheid 
years. Certain businesses, especially the mining industry, were involved 
in helping design and implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture 
industry benefited from its privileged access to land.
