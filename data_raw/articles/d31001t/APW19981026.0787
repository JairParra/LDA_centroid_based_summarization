The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report 
that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights 
violations as it struggled to overcome white rule. The 3,500-page 
report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more 
than two years of nationwide hearings. South African media released 
preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release 
on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. The release of the document 
is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority 
rule to democracy. The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty, 
was tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and 
why of apartheid-era atrocities. With the ANC now in power and facing 
an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove 
damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing. There has 
been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on 
white governments and their security forces during the years under 
scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission 
would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that 
the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting 
a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary 
findings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said 
the two movements were ``morally and politically accountable'' for 
gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South 
African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that 
despite ANC policy against killing civilians, the line between military 
and civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned the 
planting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents, 
torture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for 
killing political opponents. It said the party must accept responsibility 
for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, 
Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, 
accused of killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also 
said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy 
in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed 
by blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria, 
would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC. 
``I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expect everyone 
to agree. It will lead to healthy debate,'' he said. He said that 
if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses, 
it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether 
to proceed. The director is appointed by the government. The commission's 
work is designed ``to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa, 
and to establish the principle of accountability,'' Omar said. The 
ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying 
weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were 
in the offing. The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request 
a meeting with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, 
to avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected ``with contempt'' 
suggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked the findings. Constand 
Viljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC 
had done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even-handed. 
Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed 
during a ``just war.'' F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, 
meanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission 
report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. 
``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar said, 
but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.
