Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting 
apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, 
an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing 
local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research 
head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the 
psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could 
alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. ``We must give 
attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of 
perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said. 
The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining 
mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged 
with probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle. 
As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the end 
of the month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic 
exploration of their bloody past. With the power to grant amnesty 
to many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, the process 
has at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life. Many 
whites see the panel as favoring the black liberation movements, while 
many blacks accuse it of being too soft on former state officials, 
especially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed 
for tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crimes, 
saying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone. ``We 
all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil,'' 
he said. Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police 
death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling 
more than 200 years after a killing spree that costs dozens of lives. 
De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes. Dan Stein, a specialist 
in neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers 
from all sides in the conflict by his sheer ``banality of evil''. 
``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary, even 
likeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinates dubbed 
``Prime Evil.'' Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter 
was gunned down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town 
bar, said it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled 
them to do wrong. Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates 
she had attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and 
supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentences. 
After describing how she hugged the three members of the black nationalist 
Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together 
with their victims, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50-strong 
audience. ``We must take the initiative in understanding others and 
start the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land,'' 
she said, her voice shaking with emotion.
