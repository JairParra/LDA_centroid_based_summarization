A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National 
Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, 
the state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led the struggle 
against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged 
it was told to expect implication in right violations. The Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years 
of investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming 
blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security 
services. President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy 
on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with 
the report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been 
leaked a ``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically 
and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and 
after the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said 
he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in 
advance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross 
human rights violations.'' Commission officials could not immediately 
be reached for comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists 
in Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment. Former 
President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent 
the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored 
terror. ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar 
said, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay. The ANC 
was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners 
earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. 
The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the 
planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps 
in Angola and bombings. Omar said he expected the report's conclusions 
to set off debate but added it would ``lay the basis for reconciliation.''
