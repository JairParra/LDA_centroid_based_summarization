Criminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against 
white rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor 
said Monday. Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, 
the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed 
generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson 
Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African 
National Congress, he said. The remarks by d'Oliveira, who recently 
was appointed a deputy national director of prosecutions, were the 
clearest signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures 
accused by the commission of gross human rights violations. The commission 
released its report Oct. 30. It chronicles the human rights abuses 
committed by apartheid governments and their operatives as well as 
by the African National Congress and others fighting the racist system. 
The issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel that 
dragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the apartheid era 
will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters 
of prosecution feel that denying justice to the victims is a worse 
evil. On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures 
could have an impact on national elections next year, when the party 
will seek to consolidate its hold on power. The panel's chairman, 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has called for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; 
d'Oliveira called the period ``wholly impractical.'' The prosecutor 
did not name the other targets. ``We have always worked on the principle 
of that we will prosecute the highest rank,'' he said. The commission 
has the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds 
and are found to have acted with political motives. The report said 
individuals who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela 
has not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable for human 
rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said 
killed and tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted 
in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to an assault on four 
young men. She was sentenced to six years in jail, but paid a dlrs 
3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC official was among the most prominent 
anti-apartheid activists. The two generals were implicated during 
Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready to move forward 
pending the amnesty application of one.
