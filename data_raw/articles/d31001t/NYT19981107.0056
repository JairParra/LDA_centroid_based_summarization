The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered 
was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you 
will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After 
more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the 
commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of 
people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied 
for amnesty. So the prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so 
fast. The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela 
before talk of new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that nearly all 
of South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African 
National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock 
because of the report. Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the 
country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and 
many political analysts here are betting that an agreement ``of mutual 
benefit'' is in the offing. Already, three major political parties 
are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing 
the door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to 
talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was 
discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South 
Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province 
with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. In choosing a 
truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style trial with which to 
close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation. 
People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would 
then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a 
model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering 
how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past. But 
given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not 
come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated 
by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. 
It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's South 
Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment, crime, 
white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind up settling 
for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the 
unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to 
move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity 
in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South 
Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and 
to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test. Certainly 
the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its 
past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed 
genitals and near suffocations. And the commission's work added much 
to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 
and 1994. But it will be years before the effect of the commission 
can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will 
vendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: 
Four years after South Africa held its first non-racial elections, 
a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past. 
Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern 
Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the 
February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next 
year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have this country torn 
apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is going to be howling 
for an amnesty. They already are.'' Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 
the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating 
a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move 
would be highly unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead 
that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted 
would in effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition 
to any proposals to limit prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights 
and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn 
such proposals as ``unconscionable.'' The idea for a Truth Commission 
emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about 
South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state 
to a non-racial democracy. During the talks, the white National Party 
government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. In the 
end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them 
foot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former 
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan 
van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings. In its report, 
the commission called the apartheid state the ``primary perpetrator'' 
of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former 
officials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg 
Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. 
These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty 
For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution 
of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused 
in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions. 
Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC is held responsible 
for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems are further 
complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu-based 
Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one from that party came forward 
to ask for amnesty. Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with 
the white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in 
KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's 
leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand 
accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. But prosecuting Chief 
Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. Part of the reluctance 
to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another 
factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime 
and the evidence from the apartheid era is old. So why spend the time 
and the money? At the moment, only one political party is opposed 
to any form of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, 
a liberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony 
Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglike 
your behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes that 
his is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there is little 
enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.''
