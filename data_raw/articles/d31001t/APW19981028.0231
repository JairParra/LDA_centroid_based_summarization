A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will 
not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human 
rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge. De Klerk said 
he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday. The 
man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding 
by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the fact'' to bombings 
in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor 
federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, 
said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, 
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying 
its release. ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously 
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been 
engaged in a vendetta against him. ``But we must and will respect 
the courts and his rights under the constitution. We fought hard for 
those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk 
now shares in them,'' he said in a statement. ``All we are doing is 
postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu later told The Associated 
Press. ``The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha has 
died down.'' De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment 
before speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts. 
The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying 
bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the country 
for more than two years, listening to victims and perpetrators seeking 
amnesty. The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone 
for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. 
De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted 
by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the liberation 
movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the country, on 
Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was guilty of human 
rights violations in its armed struggle. The report will be a broad 
and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 
1960 to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule. It 
will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. 
Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being 
named as rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported 
Wednesday. In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more 
than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give 
them a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out 
of the report, he said.
