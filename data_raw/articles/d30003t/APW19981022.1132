A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil. ``There is a climate 
of division, confrontation and instability in Chile,'' parliamentary 
deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean 
ambassador. Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite 
the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
In Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of 
victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired 
general's supporters. Espina also warned that the issue was damaging 
relations between Chile Spain and Britain. Spain was the biggest single 
investor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain. The deputy 
arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senators Jovino 
Movoa and Julio Lagos. The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group 
of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in 
London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic 
Union and the National Renovation Party. Espina, Movoa and Lagos were 
hoping to talk to officials from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and 
other government representatives. ``All we ask is that Spain stops 
meddling in our internal affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean 
problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts. ``We stopped being 
a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of becoming 
one again,'' he added. Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the 
state-owned news agency EFE reported. Aznar has promised his government 
will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government 
if asked to do so by the judicial authorities. But the extradition 
attempt could be annulled by legal challenges in Spain well before 
the deadline for presenting it in Britain. The deadline is set for 
November 25th _ coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's 
detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant. A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction 
of Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult. The decision 
is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, as 
these crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code.
