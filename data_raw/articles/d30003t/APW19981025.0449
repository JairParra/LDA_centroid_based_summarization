The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate 
of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of 
their judicial authorities and they will not interfere. ``Both myself 
and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria 
Aznar. ``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't 
intend to do so.'' Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists 
on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. 
Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone for 
back surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 1973-90 rule. The Chilean government has urged Britain 
to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a 
senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Aznar dismissed reports 
that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin 
America. ``It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. 
This is stupid.''
