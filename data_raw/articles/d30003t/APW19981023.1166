Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes 
committed during his 17-year rule. ``Sometimes it should be made clear 
that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' 
European Commission President Jacques Santer said. Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism. ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent 
many citizens into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 
Pinochet regime. Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern 
Spanish city of Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias 
Prize for social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after 
the heir to the Spanish throne. Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported 
Friday that Pinochet is not fully aware of his predicament. Daily 
El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and aides have been 
shielding him from the details for fear he would fly into a rage that 
would kill him. Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering 
from back surgery. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean 
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. 
The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, 
and daughter Veronica. ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have 
an attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to 
others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her 
husband on the eighth floor of the clinic. She said she was particularly 
concerned because he is also suffering from a urinary infection, heart 
problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported. El Mundo reported that 
the family had asked police guards to stand outside the former dictator's 
room and keep out of sight. The paper said the room lacked television, 
radio or telephone. According to the report Pinochet was informed 
of the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a 
mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, 
a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer 
close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation 
after flying to London Thursday. TV13 reported that the unidentified 
officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one 
soldier to another.''
