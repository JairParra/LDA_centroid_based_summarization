As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began 
in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet 
has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx 
of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the 
arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, 
is not a Spanish citizen. They also maintained that as a former head 
of state, the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while 
in office. His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982. On the opposing side, Alun 
Jones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case, 
defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention 
in London. The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.'' After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's 
senior judge, said the court was expected to decide the matter on 
Tuesday. The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain 
in hope of the general's early release. But efforts to prevent that 
gathered strength elsewhere in Europe. In Geneva, a public prosecutor, 
Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's 
arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean 
citizen in 1977. Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation 
in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, 
who was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. 
The prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to 
seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. 
At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, 
of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 
dictatorship, filed suit in a French court. In addition, a human rights 
group in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court 
on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappeared 
in Chile in 1973. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating 
magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he 
had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg 
to block bank accounts held by the general. Court officials in Madrid 
said Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their possible 
use later as compensation to relatives of victims. In London, British 
officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile. Supporters and opponents of 
the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being 
held. From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign 
minister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private 
clinic in central London. From Europe have come dozens of longtime 
opponents of the general who were forced into exile after his 1973 
coup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens. 
The exiles, along with others, stand daily outside the clinic holding 
up photographs of missing relatives and shouting anti-Pinochet slogans. 
On occasion there have been shouting matches between the two sides. 
``He is ill, and in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano Fernandez, 
Chile's deputy foreign minister, said after visiting Pinochet who 
had minor surgery for a back ailment. After his surgery on Oct. 9, 
the general was arrested by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct. 
16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensued now involve 
at least five governments. The political and legal imbroglio could 
end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general 
should be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age 
and failing health. Last week he said that in exercising his powers 
under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses 
are of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any 
compassionate circumstances.''
