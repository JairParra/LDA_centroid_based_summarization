The Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank 
accounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a 
spokesman said Wednesday. Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said 
a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition 
aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have 
in Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova 
said no accounts have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation 
order has been given to federal banking authorities. Pinochet has 
been held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. 
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges 
of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 
1990. On Monday, Switzerland also requested Pinochet's arrest and 
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. The move 
followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva last week by the widow 
of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who 
disappeared in May 1977. Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort 
to extradite Pinochet should be given priority. A Spanish request 
for legal assistance from Switzerland, made Friday, has been passed 
on to Geneva authorities. No details have been given of the content 
of the Spanish request.
