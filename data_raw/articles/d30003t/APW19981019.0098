Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one 
lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator 
has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous. Chilean officials, meanwhile, 
issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to 
argue for Pinochet's release. The former strongman's son vowed to 
hire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile 
with an iron fist for 17 years. British police arrested Pinochet in 
his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request 
from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of 
murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973. Pinochet had 
gone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9. ``The idea that 
such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity 
I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching 
stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. television interview Sunday. Home Office Minister Alun Michael 
acknowledged Sunday that Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic 
passport, but said, ``That does not necessarily convey diplomatic 
immunity.'' The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting 
on official business and accredited diplomats have immunity. Pinochet 
has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. 
His arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward 
right-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, 
which replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago and 
promised an ``ethical'' foreign policy. However, Michael Howard, a 
Conservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned 
that Pinochet was arrested as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers 
and lobby groups. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, 
saying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not 
recognizing Chile's institutions. ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian 
for 40 years and many of its present institutions are inherited from 
that regime,'' Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending 
the Ibero-American Summit. ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start 
a trial for abuses that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime 
(of Francisco Franco)?'' Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean courts 
to try events that occurred in Chile.'' Franco's reign ended in 1975. 
Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest ``an 
insult'' and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politicians 
and the military for their support. In London, police guards were 
deployed Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is believed 
to still be a patient. About 100 Chilean demonstrators pleased with 
the arrest gathered outside, chanting and waving placards bearing 
faded black and white portraits with the caption ``Disappeared in 
Chile.'' Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago was 
the scene of dueling demonstrations Sunday, reflecting the long-standing 
division of public opinion over Pinochet. The rallies were mostly 
peaceful, although riot police used tear gas and water cannons on 
some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines 
into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests or injuries 
were reported. The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release, 
Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up 
to Pinochet's family. Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would 
hire ``the best legal team available in London.'' Several right-wing 
Chilean politicians, including some who held posts in the Pinochet 
regime, also were flying to London to show their support to their 
former boss. Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday 
to formally apply for extradition. The final decision lies with British 
Home Secretary Jack Straw. There was no immediate word on when Pinochet 
would be questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said questioning was not expected for a week or two. Pinochet 
has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances 
and deaths of political opponents. His arrest was prompted by applications 
last week to question him by two Spanish judges investigating human 
rights violations. One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question 
Pinochet about the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina. 
The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about allegations 
that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In Chile, 
seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or dead under the 
Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and a U.N. official. 
According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political 
opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term. Pinochet, commander-in-chief 
of the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in 
Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government 
crafted. He is also covered under an amnesty for crimes committed 
before 1978 _ when most of the human rights abuses took place.
