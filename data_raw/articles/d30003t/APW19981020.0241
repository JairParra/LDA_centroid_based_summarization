Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in 
a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid 
growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, 
who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and 
her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district 
four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 
9. ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, 
spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister 
from 1979-90. The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish 
magistrate's request. In Conservative government days, Pinochet was 
welcomed on regular visits that included tea with the prime minister. 
He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its 1982 
war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and 
Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of right-wing economics. 
The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago, ending 18 years 
of Conservative Party rule. Chile's ambassador delivered a formal 
protest to the Foreign Office on Monday, saying Britain has violated 
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic 
passport and is also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him 
from prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture 
and other human rights abuses against political opponents in which, 
the Chilean government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. 
He remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March. The magistrate 
broadened his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well 
as Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is no diplomatic immunity. 
Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's 
rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity 
and senator status. ``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' 
Artaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. 
``What we are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government 
is the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people 
do not understand and many people don't like.'' ``We're not discussing 
his record during his period of dictatorship, that the present government 
does not support at all,'' added the ambassador. A Chilean specialist 
in international law was traveling to London for further meetings 
with British officials, Artaza said. Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized 
for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts 
to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated 
the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's 
court. British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government 
of ``gesture'' politics and pandering to the party's left-wing.
