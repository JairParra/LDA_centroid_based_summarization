Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest 
in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it 
a case of ``international meddling.'' ``It seems to me that what has 
happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters 
covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro 
had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city 
hotel. He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.'' 
Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British 
police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The judge is 
probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his 
rule in the 1970s and 80s. The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest. Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit. Castro compared the action with the 
establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, 
a move Cuba has expressed reservations about. Castro said the court 
ought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we 
already know who commands there,'' an apparent reference to the United 
States. The United States was one of only seven countries that voted 
against creating the court. ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the 
problem is delicate'' and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament 
and armed forces bear watching, Castro said. He expressed surprise 
that the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided 
support to England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland 
Islands. Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was 
accused of providing military intelligence to the British. Castro 
joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 
24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit 
being held here. ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet 
instead of the summit,'' he said. Pinochet left government in 1990, 
but remained as army chief until March when he became a senator-for-life.
