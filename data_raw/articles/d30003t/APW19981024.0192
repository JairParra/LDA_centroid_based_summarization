The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for 
his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face 
charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful 
Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London 
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back 
surgery. 'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, 
very, very, ill.'' Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated 
disc, a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement. He 
was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. The 
Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to include 
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule. 
Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator he 
enjoys diplomatic immunity _ and because he is in poor health. Unconfirmed 
media reports in Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who has 
worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, also has a urinary tract 
infection. There have also been reports that he is suffering from 
depression. In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers 
for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British 
police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case 
resumes Monday. Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army 
commander until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator 
for life, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.
