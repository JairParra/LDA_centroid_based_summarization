The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``Despite everything 
that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government 
or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In 
a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said 
Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion about the 
extradition.'' British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
But it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears it 
could damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after Pinochet 
left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile, followed 
closely by Britain. Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that 
Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical 
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within 
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. 
``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty 
but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said. Blair added that should 
Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and 
act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision 
on an extradition request from Spain. The tone of the British Prime 
Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with 
Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter 
Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for 
Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.'' The European extradition convention gives 
Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British 
authorities via the Spanish government. But while Spanish Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the 
process if it reaches his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never 
have to do so. Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have 
appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile 
and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. ``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. The appeals argue 
that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are 
none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international 
courts. A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision 
in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt.
