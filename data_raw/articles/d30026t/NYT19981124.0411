America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace 
largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to 
flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic 
mail while checking the weather and sports scores. Now, the company 
has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate 
executives in pin-stripe suits. Nearly lost in the complexity of America 
Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's 
announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind 
the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores. 
Netscape already has created software that made it a player in providing 
support for what is already known as electronic commerce. But America 
Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software, 
consulting and services for online merchants. ``Most companies that 
sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce 
space,'' said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference 
Tuesday. ``We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end 
solution.'' The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester 
Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic 
commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range 
from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores. 
By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce 
services and software should top $35 billion. ``E-commerce services 
are the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take 
advantage of the true business opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci 
Gere, an analyst at International Data Corp. ``The market is growing 
very rapidly, but it is very fragmented.'' Analysts say the leader 
today in e-commerce services is IBM, which has a full line of offerings 
from sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting. Other 
competitors include well-known information technology consulting companies 
such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen 
accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems 
for big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting 
and consulting separately but under one umbrella. Software companies 
like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with 
little or no consulting to help customers use them. There are also 
plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic 
commerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started 
basically as advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web 
and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those 
two strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending 
merger with CKS Group. America Online argues that its advantage in 
this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad 
subscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software, 
plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's 
venture into electronic commerce engineering. ``This is the first 
time anyone has put a true end-to-end solution that starts with the 
silicon and ends with the audience,'' said Barry Schuler, America 
Online's president for interactive services. ``We start with Sun's 
line of servers, then the commerce tools to build a store, the support 
services to process orders and then a deal for online real estate 
that can drive the traffic.'' Despite the advantages Netscape and 
Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems 
in its new quest. Chief among them is whether it can appear to have 
the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers 
demand. ``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when 
it comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior 
analyst with Forrester Research. Its decision to keep Netscape as 
a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership 
with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. ``America 
Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added. ``It looks 
like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape 
and Sun.'' Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented 
companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, 
that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services 
that big corporate clients demand. ``Telecommunications companies 
that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers 
have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships,'' 
she said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the 
e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to 
sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online. 
``We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar 
stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he said. ``They have 
an online store, but their square footage is too small.'' Even before 
the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic 
commerce software and services. It has been rewriting the software 
that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally 
accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language 
used only on America Online. This new software, which now will be 
combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available 
for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. Similarly, 
it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their 
credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases 
without retyping all that information each time. America Online is 
working to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader Internet. 
There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic 
commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies 
decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional 
sale in stores. There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed, 
ranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites 
to a company's existing inventory and accounting systems. There are 
creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer 
list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there 
are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big 
servers that users connect to when they use the online stores that 
display catalogs, take orders and process payments. America Online, 
Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather 
than back-office functions. ``We will consult on how to merchandise 
and sell online,'' he said. ``We understand the consumer piece of 
the puzzle.'' Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic 
commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and 
hardware. ``The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the 
best possible solution for their business,'' said Robert Gett, the 
chief executive of Viant. ``If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, 
their answer is a bit tainted.'' Netscape does have an expanding force 
of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. 
But they have been most competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts 
projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and 
carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web. ``They say, `Who knows 
our software better than Netscape?''' Gett said. ``We help customers 
decide which platform is best for them.'' But America Online argues 
that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business 
needs. ``We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and 
services, is the huge revenue stream of the future,'' Schuler said. 
``We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg.''
