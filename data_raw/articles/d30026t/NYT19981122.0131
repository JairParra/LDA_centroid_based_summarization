America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications 
Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust 
suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said 
Sunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving 
AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service 
with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular 
site on the World Wide Web and its software business. But as part 
of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development 
partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business 
of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to 
serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands 
of users at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares 
for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal 
could be announced as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved 
in the talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to 
be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three 
businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services, 
Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two 
of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same 
time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker 
once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance 
of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded in 1994, 
has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft. 
Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser 
software used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding 
to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly 
matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the 
Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows 
operating system and giving it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape 
announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, 
as Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape 
has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction 
fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software 
to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which 
to conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has the expertise 
to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's 
programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's 
software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said. 
Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating 
systems for the large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server 
software. ``This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of 
Netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its technologies 
forward,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business 
school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology of a recent book, ``Competing on Internet 
Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft.'' The impact 
of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft 
is uncertain. It does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's 
defense _ namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where 
corporate alliances shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust 
policy should tread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, 
should have no direct effect on the current case. ``No matter how 
much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's 
monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect 
its monopoly,'' said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial 
lawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL 
and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. 
And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer 
James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, 
or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people 
close to the talks. Industry analysts suggest that the companies may 
have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly 
on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. 
And representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon 
Valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's 
rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL.
