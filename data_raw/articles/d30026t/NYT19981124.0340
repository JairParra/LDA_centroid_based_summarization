Envisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide Web 
is a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment, products 
and services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out the details of 
its agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for $4.2 
billion. By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently 
come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media, 
America Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle 
already joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp. and the International 
Business Machines Corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace 
into a vast virtual mall. Part of that vision rests on an alliance 
with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the 
deal. Sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort 
but, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in developing 
Netscape's industrial-strength software for running Internet sites. 
Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight. It owns the Java programming 
language specially designed for Internet applications, and Solaris, 
among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful 
computers that big corporations use to serve up Internet services 
like the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions. It also manufactures 
a highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor 
chips. But for America Online _ and for the big Internet players against 
which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further 
down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on 
line for information or shopping not only from personal computers 
but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe 
included free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular 
phones are now. Today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist 
activity _ an estimated 25 percent of American households had access 
to the Internet last year, and 5 percent of households bought merchandise 
on line. But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that 
their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net 
is ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance-like 
devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers 
as routinely as they use the telephone today. ``A new generation of 
Internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key 
part of what this deal is about in the long run,'' said Stephen M. 
Case, 40, the chairman of America Online. For the present, however, 
the idea is to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, 
the standard way to get onto the Internet, the executives explained. 
Netscape, the Internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, 
they said. There is no assurance that this vision of the technological 
future will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the America Online-Netscape 
combination will lead the way. Still, the long-range game plan helps 
explain what brought America Online and Netscape together. And the 
ability of the companies' executives to sell that vision to Netscape's 
whiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger 
succeeds. Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., is likely 
become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters. As is the case 
with any software company, Netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, 
and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America 
Online, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering 
to online newcomers, known derisively as ``newbies.'' Stock options 
and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep Netscape 
employees on board. ``But these people want to change the world, and 
we've got to be clear that joining with America Online, along with 
the Sun component, really is a bigger opportunity for us,'' said Marc 
Andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of 
young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University 
of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company 
in 1994. ``This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the 
next decade,'' Andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on 
a streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape 
executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology 
officer for the next three or four months, until the merger is completed. 
His new job at America Online has not yet been determined, but it 
is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as 
well, an America Online executive said. Already, according to one 
Netscape board member, Andreessen has delivered a 12-page single-spaced 
memorandum to Case, setting out his view of the technological road 
map the new company should follow into the future, emphasizing the 
opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most 
people are linked to the Internet. Netscape, populated with computing 
sophisticates, and America Online, known as an on-ramp to the Internet 
for the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple. But 
the two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving toward 
each other for more than a year. In a telephone interview from America 
Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an 
enterprise that had ``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on 
sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in 
Microsoft's cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising 
and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling 
software to corporations to handle electronic commerce. The Netscape 
transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault 
on its browser business _ a central element in the government's antitrust 
suit against Microsoft. Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard 
Windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free. The 
government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive 
practices, while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly 
to benefit consumers. Early this year, after laying off workers and 
suffering a large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would 
also distribute its browser for free. It seems to have stabilized 
its business around its new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that 
it earned $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal 
quarter, which ended in September. Yet America Online has also changed 
in the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as 
an online service for beginners. It now has an Internet chat service 
and runs its own all-in-one site on the Web, known as a ``portal,'' 
which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and 
online shopping. ``America Online has really changed from a closed 
online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology 
company with a diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said. ``These two 
companies have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a 
good one.''
