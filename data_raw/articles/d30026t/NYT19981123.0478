Microsoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition 
of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermined 
the government's antitrust suit against the software giant. ``From 
a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under 
the government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president 
for legal affairs, said Monday morning on the courthouse steps. The 
reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, is that the proposed 
deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are 
healthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive 
practices alleged in the government's suit. But David Boies, the government's 
lead attorney, said all of that was irrelevant. ``Whatever the deal 
ends up being _ if there ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove 
any of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition 
in this industry,'' he said. Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer 
who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, 
suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition 
undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed 
toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match 
the one it apparently holds in operating systems. After all, about 
22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America 
Online. And at present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet 
Explorer, as the service's default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft 
places an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98. Lacovara 
asked the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires in 
January, he would ``expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft 
software.'' Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. ``It is not at all clear 
to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed 
merger with Netscape.'' He noted that America Online officials had 
said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows 
forced them to accept Microsoft terms _ establishing Internet Explorer 
as the default choice. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question 
that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and Microsoft's 
larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal. ``Surely 
this combination,'' he asked, ``tells you something about the nature 
of competition in the software industry?'' Warren-Boulton's answer 
was probably not the one Lacovara had been after. ``To the extent 
that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions with 
these exclusive contracts and other actions,'' he said, ``it is unfortunate 
to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest 
star.'' Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is 
to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system 
software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft 
operating system. That is the foundation under most of the government's 
case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist 
that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition. Through 
repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried to make 
the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral. 
The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, 
that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _ 
a point of view the company encourages among its employees. On Friday 
and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are 
placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies 
_ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for 
these new systems. But Warren-Boulton argued that ``the existence 
of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not 
mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power.'' On 
Monday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer 
Co. is having selling its new iMac computer. He entered into evidence 
an Apple news release issued last month showing, among other things, 
that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had 
previously owned a Windows machine. Apple computers use a different 
operating system, Mac-OS.
