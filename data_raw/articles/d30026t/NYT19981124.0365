The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America 
Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with 
Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape 
can change in fast-moving technical fields. But it does not lessen 
the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust 
suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department 
has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly 
in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off 
competition in other software realms. The Internet has risen so quickly 
as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book ``The 
Road Ahead,'' Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, only a 
couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest online service, 
was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it 
was widely derided as ``America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved 
so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing 
it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward 
to make deals with other Internet players. In its antitrust suit against 
Microsoft, the federal government charges that the company has illegally 
bundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother 
Netscape's chances of marketing its browser. Now in the corridors 
outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape 
has found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection 
from the government. But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft 
has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale 
to America Online. Nor is it clear that customers of America Online 
will choose Netscape's browser as a vehicle for buying and selling 
on the Internet. Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online 
remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement 
of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen. It may be that, years hence, 
America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative 
means to the Internet through telephone lines, cables or the like. 
But until that day, fairness requires Justice Department action to 
insure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer 
choice. Only when companies know they can get their products to the 
consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet 
into the revolutionary medium it promises to be.
