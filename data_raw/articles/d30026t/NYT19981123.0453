America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two 
promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another 
company _ the Internet media business and electronic commerce. With 
its proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, the nation's 
largest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers, 
hopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal. If the 
$4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not reached a final 
agreement as of Monday night _ AOL would acquire a leading Internet 
brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who 
regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site on the World Wide 
Web. ``Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role 
as the premier Internet media company,'' said James F. Moore, president 
of Geopartners Inc., a consulting firm. ``America Online is assembling 
the kind of audience numbers that will convince people the Internet 
is becoming a mainstream media.'' In the new media business, as in 
traditional media like television or newspapers, eyeballs translate 
into advertising revenue. But what really intrigues media executives 
and consumer marketers about the new media _ news, entertainment and 
services rendered in computer code _ is that it is inherently a two-way 
medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the 
click of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers 
want to see, of course, is buying. And it is the potential for exploiting 
an instant, direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the 
recent optimism about electronic commerce. Today, companies are selling 
everything from books to baby clothes over the Internet. Most companies 
have not progressed beyond the experimentation stage, but there are 
a handful of encouraging success stories like Amazon.com, the on-line 
bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing 
trends in cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach 
$3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sales worldwide. AOL is at the 
forefront of this convergence of media and commerce converge, and 
integration reflected in the lineage of its leaders. Steve Case, the 
chairman, was once a new-product manager for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, 
while Robert Pittman, the president, is a former MTV executive. Microsoft 
is also investing heavily in new media and electronic commerce. It 
has an online service, MSN, which competes with AOL, as well as information-and 
commerce Web sites that focus on travel, cars and real estate. It 
also owns Sidewalk, a network of local sites that list movies, restaurants 
and stores in cities around the country including Seattle and New 
York. Its MSNBC Internet news service is half of a joint venture with 
NBC. Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce 
business. It has no shortage of bright people and it has more money 
than any rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft has the built-in advantage 
in any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system 
runs more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today. Its control 
of the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial 
real estate in the information age. In theory, at least, owning that 
desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online 
offerings _ an issue that is key to the government's antitrust suit 
against Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft has started slowly in the 
fields of Internet media and electronic commerce. ``Microsoft may 
want to, but it does not dominate these new markets,'' said Richard 
Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm. ``America 
Online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth 
businesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft 
on head-on.'' Still, if the Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also 
find itself in the software business in a way it has never been in 
the past. Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development 
of software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft saw the 
browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and 
pursued that market aggressively, bundling its own browser with its 
Windows and giving it away free _ tactics that have been challenged 
by the government. But Netscape no longer generates revenues from 
its browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the 
sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations. Much of this software 
is used as the technological ``back office'' for electronic commerce 
_ used in building Web sites and processing transactions. A surprising 
element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape's 
corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established 
software company. ``America Online just doesn't have credibility in 
that market,'' observed Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. Executives close 
to AOL explain the decision as the need to provide full-line offerings 
for electronic commerce, from corporate Web site to the computer screens 
of consumers. But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen 
Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it has brought 
in Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal, which has complicated the 
transaction considerably. AOL, according to executives close to the 
proposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing 
and development partnership with Sun. As part of the deal, AOL will 
agree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's computers for 
its service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable 
amounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. Still, 
AOL and Sun have a longer-term objective as well _ one that promises 
to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft. For nearly a 
year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, has been working 
closely with AOL, according to Sun executives. A former Harvard economics 
professor who taught Scott McNealy, the Sun chairman, Raduchel has 
focused on Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java and 
Jini, both of which are seen as potential threats to Microsoft's dominance. 
By combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer 
brand, the Sun executives say, there is the potential for a kind end-run 
around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing. In its research laboratories, 
Sun has been working on a stripped-down network computer _ a simple-to-use 
information appliance, which could cost as little as $200 or be given 
away as part of a subscription service. The concept is that AOL's 
Internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered 
to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense 
and difficulty of using a personal computer. The appliance would be 
mainly a receiver and screen, with most of the computing power residing 
on vast central computers serving up information as users request 
by tapping a few buttons. Sun's technological specialty is this kind 
of centralized ``network'' computing. If the long-term AOL-Sun vision 
ever materialized _ certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least 
_ it could give both companies a boost and technological independence 
from Microsoft.
