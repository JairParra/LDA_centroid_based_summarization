America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications 
Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust 
suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said 
Sunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving 
AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service 
with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular 
site on the World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also 
enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun 
Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to 
large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web 
pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at 
the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape 
stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be 
announced as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved in the 
talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated. 
The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses 
at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services, Internet 
software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's 
leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, 
it would end the independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software 
maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's 
dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 
in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from 
Microsoft. Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for 
the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, 
responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, 
quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling 
the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard 
Windows operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's 
browser technology caught up to Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape 
announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, 
as Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape 
has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction 
fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software 
to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which 
to conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes it has the expertise 
to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's 
programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's 
software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said. 
Among large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among 
the most popular operating systems for the powerful computers that 
run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would be 
placed under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three companies 
had combined revenues of more than $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, 
by comparison, had revenues of more than $14 billion. ``This deal 
would insure that the fundamental elements of Netscape survive within 
bigger companies that can drive its technologies forward,'' said David 
B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author 
with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
of a recent book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape 
and Its Battle with Microsoft.'' The impact of the deal, if any, on 
the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It 
does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, 
that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances 
shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should 
tread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, should have 
no direct effect on the current case. ``No matter how much the alliances 
shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly 
and how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly,'' 
said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the 
Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems 
are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger 
talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and 
AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the 
start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talks. 
Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened 
to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on the perception 
that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives 
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture 
capital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's rivals, 
sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executives involved 
in the talks said that the timing of the proposed deal was unrelated 
to the antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded 
as ``a single-minded attempt to circle the wagons against Microsoft.'' 
Indeed, AOL, according to one person close to the talks, plans to 
keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice on 
its on-line service. One of the government's allegations in the antitrust 
suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for 
AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip. 
To win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate on 
the Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal 
computers sold today. Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen 
as proof that AOL still regards placement on the Windows desktop as 
crucial, as well as a careful step to avoid undermining one of the 
allegations in the government's case. For AOL, the Netscape purchase 
would accelerate its evolution toward the Internet. At present, its 
flagship on-line service is a hybrid _ to its own proprietary service, 
it has added a gateway to the World Wide Web. In addition, for consumers 
who do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also has its own 
Web site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitors a month, 
according to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm. 
Its big Web site offers a wide range of information, entertainment, 
Internet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the all-in-one sites 
that have become known as portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic has 
slipped a bit in recent months, to under 16 million visitors a month, 
but it, too, is a major portal. Together, they should be a huge player 
in the intensifying portal battle for viewers and resulting advertising 
revenues. Yahoo is the current leader among portal sites with more 
than 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attracts 
more than 20 million a month. Though known as a new-media company 
for consumers, AOL is also interested in boosting its electronic commerce 
business with the Netscape purchase. AOL has recently done work with 
Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promoting 
their products to on-line subscribers but also building the Internet 
infrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes 
projections like a recent one from Forrester Research Inc., which 
predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach as high as 
$3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sales. Sun Microsystems, 
analysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for 
Internet commerce software. Sun is a corporate software company with 
a sales force of several thousand. As it moves increasingly to Internet 
technology, AOL should prove an excellent partner for Sun in terms 
of developing and using Sun's Java, an Internet programming language. 
And while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue on its own, 
it is a distribution channel for Java technology. Having Netscape's 
browser safely in the hands of a friendly company is of strategic 
importance for Sun, since Microsoft owns the alternative in the browser 
market. AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's 
stock price on Friday, executives close to the deal said, since Netscape 
shares have more than doubled in the last month. In the last week 
alone, Netscape's stock has jumped about $12, or nearly 45 percent, 
following reports that it was discussing a possible partnership with 
AOL. The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up $2.625. AOL's shares 
gained $1.50 Friday, closing at $84.875.
