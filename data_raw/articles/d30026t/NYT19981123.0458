Stock prices vaulted to record levels Monday, furthering a recovery 
that as recently as two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable. ``I 
thought we were in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never 
thought or wrote that the bull market was over,'' said Byron Wien, 
U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``Now 
it seems all of that is behind us.'' The Dow Jones industrial average 
rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27. The record is the 
first since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, 
when the Dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep slide, the blue-chip 
gauge has risen more than 24 percent. For the year, the Dow is up 
18.54 percent and has a chance of rising more than 20 percent for 
a fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader 
averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set 
a record, rising 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq 
composite index did not reach a new high but posted the biggest percentage 
gain Monday, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. And 
the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, 
or nearly 1 percent, to 398.15. Monday's action was energized by a 
daily record for the number of mergers and acquisitions valued at 
$1 billion or more. The merger announcements not only prompted investors 
to change estimates of how much companies were worth but also indicated 
coming declines in the outstanding shares of stock. ``This may be 
a supply-demand story, where demand for stocks is rising and the supply 
of stock is reduced as one company after another merges,'' said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The flow 
of money into mutual funds is fairly strong, and there is pressure 
on managers to put that money to work.'' Two deals seemed to be catalysts 
for broad swaths of stocks. News that Bankers Trust may be close to 
accepting an $8.9 billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heightened 
interest in financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America 
Online may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock 
powered Internet and other technology stocks to even loftier valuations. 
Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gained 6 1/16, to 115 11/16. 
American Express was up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 
4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, to 
42}. Netscape was the most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, to 41 
15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, to 89\. Other Internet stocks 
also surged, and analysts said the group, which has seen meteoric 
gains in recent weeks, was ripe for a steep correction. Yahoo and 
Amazon.com both became $200 stocks on Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 
to 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, to 218. ``The performance 
of the Internet stocks is an unsettling sign,'' Wien said. Still, 
more-established technology shares also had a very good day. IBM rose 
7, to 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, to 119 3/16. And Intel closed 
at 113 9/16, up 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien said that 
according to his calculations, stocks were about 10 percent overvalued. 
By contrast, in the middle of July the market was 20 percent overvalued, 
he said. Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which has been buttressed 
by three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, has 
left many longtime Wall Street hands grasping for historical parallels. 
``At this point we are in new ground,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads 
his own market research firm. ``At the beginning of the year, I said 
my target for the Dow was 10,000 by the end of 1998. If anyone had 
asked when the market went through what now looks like a corrective 
blip, I would have said my new target would have been about 9,000. 
I am surprised the 10,000 figure came back on the table'' for this 
year.
