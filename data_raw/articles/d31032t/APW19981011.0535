President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this 
spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because 
he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said. Yeltsin appeared stiff 
and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, 
the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported 
by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. But the two later held a one-on-one 
summit as scheduled. The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray 
since an economic crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old 
president, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years 
in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight 
and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside 
Moscow. His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended 
a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. During 
his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected 
to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet 
republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis 
that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted 
on some of its debt. On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay 
wreaths at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, 
and salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled. 
``This week was extremely tense. (Yeltsin) was affected by a difficult 
flight and the end of a difficult week,'' Yeltsin's chief spokesman, 
Dmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference. ``He has a cold. He was 
coughing when we spoke.'' It was sunny and about 14 degrees C (57 
degrees F) in Tashkent on Sunday. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's schedule 
Monday may also change depending on how he feels. Yeltsin and Karimov 
later met at a government residence outside Tashkent and signed several 
agreements on fighting smuggling and other crime and expanding cultural 
ties. The two sides are expected to sign economic agreements Monday. 
Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on economic, 
science and technical cooperation and on combating drug trafficking. 
Last week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation in 
Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and the 
two republics fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, 
and possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked the country. 
Yeltsin was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister 
Igor Sergeyev, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, officials from the 
Federal Border Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the Defense 
Ministry, and the Russian Academy of Sciences.
