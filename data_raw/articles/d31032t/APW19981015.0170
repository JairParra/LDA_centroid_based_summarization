Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether 
Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue was controversial earlier 
this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his 
aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. It has 
lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically 
weaker and has said he will not run again. The Russian Constitution 
has a two-term limit for presidents. But Yeltsin's aides say his first 
term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months 
before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution 
took effect. Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional 
Court in February. While the case has been waiting to be heard, events 
have overtaken it. Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another 
term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding 
an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the 
economic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many 
participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that 
attracted about 1 million people. Yeltsin's growing health problems 
would also seem to rule out another election campaign. A respiratory 
infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this 
week. On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, 
voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed 
narrowly. Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences, 
but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber 
made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal 
to the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative 
on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore 
calls for an early resignation. ``The president is a strong person, 
and he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' 
Mityukov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
