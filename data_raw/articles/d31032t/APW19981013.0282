President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory 
infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived 
concerns about his ability to govern. Yeltsin was spending the day 
at his Gorky-9 country residence just outside Moscow, and will probably 
not go into the office all week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, 
told reporters. However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin 
said. Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia 
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper respiratory 
infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said 
Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there were no plans 
to hospitalize him. Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, 
including quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever 
he gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to 
function. Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve 
out the remaining two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman, 
reiterated Tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation. ``It's 
not being discussed,'' he said. ``I am personally against such a resignation 
because I think it would only bring peril to the nation.'' Yakushkin 
and other aides sought to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness. 
``Don't panic, Dad is OK,'' Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, 
who is his official image adviser, told the Kommersant business newspaper. 
Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed 
that the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known 
as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.'' ``He 
must stay in bed like any other person,'' Yakushkin said. ``However, 
knowing the president's character, he is certain to start working 
with documents and making phone calls to Russian politicians as well 
as foreign leaders in view of the current situation in Kosovo.'' But 
the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page editorial Tuesday 
that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering from something worse 
than a cold. It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current 
economic crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin 
to immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov. A Communist lawmaker also called for ``an urgent medical 
check ... on the Russian president's health'' to determine whether 
he is fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. ``Yeltsin's 
obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state 
authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' 
said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee. 
The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the 
Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's national security 
and a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapons,'' 
he said. Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's 
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former Soviet 
republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray abroad since 
a visit to Britain in May. The president appeared stiff and stumbled 
when he arrived Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had 
to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his 
other public events. At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling 
remarks, expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' 
he never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported. On Monday, ``the 
president didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant 
said, saying he called aides and spoke as though they were late for 
work at the Kremlin. He turned up more than an hour late for talks 
with Uzbek officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by 
a bad cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.
