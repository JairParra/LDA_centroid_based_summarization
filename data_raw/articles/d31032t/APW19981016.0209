Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his 
latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, 
his office said Friday. Government sources said the president has 
also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin 
said those plans were still going forward. Yeltsin has decided to 
send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deals mostly 
with financial issues, Yeltsin's office said. But sources in Primakov's 
office said the cancellation was due to concerns about how the long 
flight might effect the president's health. The president has been 
suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to 
cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday. He was spending Friday 
at a country home outside Moscow after defying the orders of his doctors 
and working in the Kremlin for the past two days. Aides said the president's 
condition was ``satisfactory.'' Yeltsin is still planning to go to 
Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations, the president's 
office said. In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered 
a potential presidential candidate, said Thursday that he wouldn't 
exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons. 
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he stopped short 
of calling on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov has always been supportive 
of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health 
or ability to govern. ``According to our constitution, the president 
himself has to say he is not able to work,'' Luzhkov said in an interview 
with the BBC in Moscow. ``And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, 
he is no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.'' 
Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the 
statement. Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including 
a heart bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles speculation 
about his fitness to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin 
has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years 
of his term.
