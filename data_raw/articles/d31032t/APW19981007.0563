President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more 
or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. 
Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated 
even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture 
on this topic.'' Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups. 
``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs. Yeltsin 
declared. The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern, 
and the worry has been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his condition. 
Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election 
and had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass surgery, in the 
months after his victory. Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for 
Russians who took part Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages. She 
also said that criticism of the president was normal, though it was 
offensive when it focused on anything other than his professional 
performance, such as his age. ``It seems to me ... that people expected 
a miracle from him,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``But surely you can't curse 
a person for not being a magician.'' Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that 
her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000 
as ``absolute nonsense.'' ``I think we'll live like all normal people. 
At least it will be calmer than it is now.''
