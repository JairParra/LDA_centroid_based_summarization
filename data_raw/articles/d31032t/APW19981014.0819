Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' 
orders and quashed rumors he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly 
at the Kremlin on Wednesday. Still, his appearance didn't silence 
the growing number of calls for his resignation. Hours after he returned 
to work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell 
just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over 
his social welfare policies. Yeltsin, 67, has a respiratory infection 
that forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in months on 
Monday. Whenever Yeltsin falls ill, speculation arises about his ability 
to govern. This time, however, the prospect of him leaving office 
has aroused less panic, since he has largely faded from the limelight 
in recent months and left his government to grapple with Russia's 
economic crisis. ``There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leaves the 
political arena. The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister 
Yevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and has the support of the security 
services,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the 
U.S.-based Heritage Foundation. ``Everyone knows Yeltsin is ailing 
and is politically weakened,'' he said. Yeltsin has a history of health 
problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists 
he has no major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two 
years of his term. ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making 
a fuss about it, he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday. 
In the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Primakov, 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian 
news agencies said. Yeltsin looked wan and tired and walked stiffly, 
but he was smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his ministers. 
The start of the meeting was shown on Russian television. Primakov 
said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively ``when we 
reminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said 
of his doctors: ``Don't listen to them.'' The upper house of parliament 
was busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The vote in the 
Federation Council, which is made up of regional leaders, was 79 to 
18 in favor, Russian news agencies reported. It did not pass because 
it required a simple majority of 90 votes. The motion carries no legal 
weight, but it reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber 
that has generally supported him. The prime minister reiterated Wednesday 
that Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections. ``There 
is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's resignation,'' 
Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``What happens 
to the anti-crisis steps if elections are held now?'' Yeltsin's resignation 
is highly unlikely. If he were to step down or die, Primakov would 
take power and elections would have to be held within three months. 
Many Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity. ``I feel for him. 
He's clearly not a healthy person,'' film director Vladimir Khotinenko 
was quoted as saying by the daily Kommersant. ``It's time for him 
to step aside.'' Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday 
and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be 
in the office all week. Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during 
his visit to Central Asia on Sunday and Monday. He canceled most of 
his public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he made 
rambling remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
