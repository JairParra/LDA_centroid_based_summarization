Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on 
Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about 
his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained 
economic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted 
doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, 
in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes. 
Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential 
decisions'' are needed. There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness 
would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president 
would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week. But after a 
series of health problems in recent years, including heart bypass 
surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation 
about the president's ability to function. The president insists he 
has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two 
years of his term. Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics 
to ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius 
(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who 
arrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day 
earlier than planned.
