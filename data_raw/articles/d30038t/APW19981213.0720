LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
on Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found guilty of 
accepting bribes. Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations 
of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior 
Swiss member Marc Hodler. But he said the allegations would be considered 
by a special IOC panel looking into alleged rules violations by the 
Salt Lake group which won the 2002 Winter Games. ``If it is necessary, 
we will expel members if this commission feels these members are guilty,'' 
Samaranch said at a news conference. ``After we get the recommendations 
of the panel, we will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem.'' 
Samaranch said the IOC was intent on protecting the integrity of the 
organization and the Olympics as a whole. ``If we have to clean, we 
will clean,'' he said. ``After, the IOC will be even stronger than 
before.'' Samaranch said he was taken aback by Hodler's allegations, 
which were made to reporters Saturday. Samaranch said Hodler should 
have brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board. ``For 
me, I was really surprised. If he has names and evidence, he must 
go to the executive board.'' Hodler said he believed four agents _ 
including one IOC member _ had been involved in vote-buying over the 
past 10 years. He said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members 
_ currently numbering 115 _ were open to bribery. Samaranch denied 
that he ``muzzled'' Hodler, as the Swiss official claimed earlier 
Sunday. He said he had told all members of the executive board that 
only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak to the 
media. ``This is not the first time I do this,'' he said. Samaranch 
expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and ruled out the 
possbility of expelling him from the IOC, an option the Swiss member 
had raised. ``Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler,'' 
Samaranch said. The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping 
Salt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the 
bid. ``No, there is not any kind of possibiity,'' he said. ``We trust 
the organizing committee of Salt Lake City.'' The Salt Lake controvery 
centers on a scholarship program that provided nearly dlrs 400,000 
in tuition and other assistance to 13 individuals _ including six 
relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Samaranch said the IOC 
would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations 
for corruption in the selection of host cities. Under current rules, 
all IOC members have a vote. Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the 
formula used by sports federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing 
body, which assign their executive boards to select sites.
