A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread 
Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver 
votes in the selection of host cities. Marc Hodler, a senior member 
of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices 
in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Hodler 
said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved 
in promising votes for payment. He declined to identify them. ``The 
four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said. ``I missed 
a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the following: they 
say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.' ``The price would 
be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of votes, 
a bloc.'' Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning 
the bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon.'' Hodler, 
an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who boasts ``that 
no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his help.'' ``No one 
can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be possible.'' He said he 
believed agents had been buying and selling votes for the past 10 
years. ``There are four agents we know,'' he said. ``One is an IOC 
member. He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding city) 
can win.'' Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, 
``I know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the 
case.'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated 
himself from Hodler's allegations. ``The only official spokeman for 
the IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard,'' 
Samaranch said. ``All the other comments are personal comments. They 
are not official comments.'' Hodler's allegations, made to a group 
of reporters, came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged 
financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid 
for the 2002 games. Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 
scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives 
of six IOC members. It also came as the former minister in charge 
of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes 
in exchange for votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, 
said he refused. Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 
1996 games was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.'' John Krimsky, 
deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's 
assertion. ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at 
this point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the 
IOC review commission.'' Hodler also leveled allegations against the 
head of the Athens bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. Hodler 
said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek businessman who led 
the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members as ``stupid'' for imposing 
restrictions on the bidding process. ``For me there is only one purpose: 
winning the games,'' Hodler quoted Metaxa as saying. ``I will do whatever 
is necessary to win the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 
10 million or dlrs 100 million.'' Hodler said he didn't know of any 
misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004 games. Asked whether 
Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean, Hodler said, ``I would 
be surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it.'' 
``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he said. 
``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.'' The committee 
which won the 1998 games for Nagano ``certainly had to do things which 
are not legitimate,'' Hodler said. Hodler contested the argument by 
the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly 
involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus 
was on former bid chief Thomas Welch. ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt 
Lake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not 
there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not 
true.'' The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition 
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC 
members by the Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee 
_ under the direction of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships 
to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from 
Africa. The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of 
the bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was 
also a high official on the bid committee. Hodler said the blame shud 
be on those ``who put pressure'' on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship 
funds. ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``We blame those 
voters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. They were a victim. 
We should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships.'' Joklik 
on Saturday denied any payment for votes. ``I don't even know what 
agents are,'' he said.
