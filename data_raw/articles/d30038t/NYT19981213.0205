Saying ``if we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch 
responded on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding 
process by declaring that IOC members who were found to have accepted 
bribes from candidate cities could be expelled. ``It is a serious 
problem we have before us,'' Samaranch, president of the International 
Olympic Committee, said in a hastily arranged news conference at a 
tumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board. Samaranch compared 
the current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. ``Those were difficult moments,'' 
Samaranch said. ``Now we are facing another difficult moment, but 
I'm sure we will solve this problem.'' Samaranch expressed surprise 
at allegations made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler 
of Switzerland that agents were offering to sell I.O.C. members' votes 
for payments from bidding cities. Hodler, the second most senior member 
of the IOC, said Saturday that he knew of four agents, including one 
IOC member, who engaged in such activities. Hodler said he believed 
that 5 to 7 percent of the IOC membership, which currently numbers 
115, asked for some sort of compensation for their vote. He has called 
for a new electoral process, in which the executive board or some 
other select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts 
instead of the full IOC membership. Samaranch agreed Sunday that the 
time had come to explore change. ``The system we have now is very 
complicated, very slow and very expensive,'' he said. Hodler, the 
former head of the International Ski Federation, also claimed that 
the Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans to influence votes 
for the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold the 1997 world skiing 
championships. Fiat denied the claims on Saturday, but Sunday Howard 
Peterson, a former senior American delegate to the ski federation, 
said he had been offered cars by two Fiat executives. The issue of 
vote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure 
of scholarship payments made to six relatives of IOC members by Salt 
Lake City officials during their successful bid to play host to the 
2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said the 
payments, which amounted to slightly less than $400,000, came from 
a privately financed fund that was started in 1991. And Intermountain 
Health Care, Utah's largest health care provider, confirmed Sunday 
that it gave free surgical services to at least two people associated 
with the IOC in 1994. A special commission headed by the IOC vice 
president Dick Pound was appointed on Friday to investigate the issue 
and has met with Salt Lake officials. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president 
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issued a public apology to 
the ``Olympic family and the citizens of Utah'' for the embarrassment 
caused by the scholarships program. Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking 
the Games from Salt Lake City. He said, ``If necessary we will expel 
members if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty.'' 
Pound said his commission was already ``satisfied Salt Lake City won 
the 2002 Games on the merit of the bid.'' He also said that his commission 
would expand its inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it 
was presented with evidence and not simply rumors of corruption in 
other bids. On Saturday, Hodler had suggested the bidding teams from 
Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, that won the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 
Winter Olympics had not run ``clean'' campaigns. Billy Payne, who 
presided over Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, the general secretary 
of the Nagano organizing committee, denied those claims. Asked whether 
he regretted his statements Sunday, Hodler said, ``Not at all'' and 
later said that ``the cities have been the victims and not the villains.'' 
Pound said there had been concern in the IOC for some time about agents. 
``There always have been lobbyists,'' he said. ``In recent years, 
especially with the Olympics coming up every two years, there seems 
to be a professional class being created.'' Hodler, when pressed for 
further comment this afternoon at Olympic headquarters, initially 
covered his mouth with both hands and then said, ``Muzzle imposed 
by the president.'' Hodler, 80, is one of only four IOC members with 
life membership because he was appointed before age limits were imposed 
in 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, ``I'm not going to resign, 
but I might be expelled.'' But the 78-year-old Samaranch said he had 
``great respect'' for Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation 
or pushing for his expulsion.
