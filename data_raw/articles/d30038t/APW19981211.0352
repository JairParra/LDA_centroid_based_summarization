What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved 
into a full-blown international scandal. The International Olympic 
Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of 
nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by 
the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC 
executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described 
as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe.'' 
``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place 
to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to 
get the vote,'' Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
assigned the international body's juridical commission _ which deals 
with legal and ethical issues _ to investigate. The inquiry will be 
headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a highly respected 
former World Court judge. The scholarship fund was first disclosed 
two weeks ago by a Salt Lake radio station. The controversy is now 
bound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake 
Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to make to the IOC executive 
board this weekend. SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne 
Friday, welcomed the IOC investigation. ``I think that's who the matter 
should be taken up by,'' he told The Associated Press. `` Of course, 
we intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and its investigation.'' 
Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's image. 
``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he said. 
Asked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he hadn't 
seen the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. But he sought to 
distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between 
the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. 
``Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the bid 
commitee before 1995,'' Joklik said. ``The organizing committee certainly 
has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any 
investigation. The facts were in the early 1990s when the bid committee 
was operating.'' U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John 
Krimsky described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's 
image and preparations for the games. ``It doesn't do us any good 
at all,'' he said. ``I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's 
review. I hope it will be a footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter.''
