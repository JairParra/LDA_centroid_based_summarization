The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter 
Olympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of 
the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games. 
Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by Marc 
Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic 
buying and selling of the Olympic Games. ``I have never heard of such 
a thing,'' Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday. ``As far as Nagano 
is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong. We were selected as 
host of the Olympics through our efforts. We can't believe that Mr. 
Hodler has made such a statement,'' he said. Tsukada was vice chairman 
of the Japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano 
has been criticized for spending a large amount of money to win the 
games. Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more 
than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to 
bring the games there has not been accounted for. Japan Olympic Committee 
has warned cities seeking to host the games in the future that they 
should not entertain IOC members excessively, the newspaper said. 
Holder's accusation might effect the invitation activities for the 
2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second largest city, the paper 
said. Osaka is competing with Beijing, China and other cities for 
the right to host the games. Nagano became the first Asian city to 
host the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 
games. Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 
to decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano led in each of the 
five rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final 
ballot.
