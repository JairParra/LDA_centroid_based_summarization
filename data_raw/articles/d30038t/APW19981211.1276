Moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders 
questioned Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation 
into alleged vote-buying by an Olympic city. Acting with unusual speed, 
the International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative 
panel that immediately summoned the organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake 
Games to address the bribery allegations. The chief investigator refused 
to rule out the possibility of taking the games away from Salt Lake 
City _ though that scenario is considered highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice 
president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for 90 minutes 
Friday night. Both sides declined to comment after the talks, saying 
the inquiry was still in process. Earlier, Joklik met with IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information 
and documents on the case. The controversy centers on the payment 
of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members 
by the Salt Lake bid committee which won the right to stage the 2002 
games. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship 
fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ 
amounted to a bribe to sway votes in the 1995 election. It's the most 
serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the IOC 
since former U.S. member Robert Helmick was accused of conflict of 
interest in 1991. Helmick eventually resigned both as an IOC member 
and as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. This is the first 
time the IOC has ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities, 
despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic 
votes. ``The executive board takes this matter very seriously,'' said 
Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the Salt Lake inquiry. 
``Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support rumors 
that have been floating around, we have never had anything come forward. 
``Specific allegations have now been made. The executive board acted 
very quickly to investigate.'' Also on the investigative panel are 
IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board members Jacques Rogge 
and Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound 
said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there may or may 
not have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their 
families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.'' Pound, a Canadian 
lawyer, said there was no deadline for completion of the investigation 
but said it was possible the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend. 
Pound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could be 
taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere. 
``We're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as to 
what we may decide until we know what the facts are,'' he said. Moving 
the games would be unprecedented and, with just over three years to 
go, would be a logistical nightmare. Most of the facilities needed 
for the games in Salt Lake already are built. John Krimsky, deputy 
secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, discounted any possibility 
of the games being moved. ``There is no chance at all, absolutely 
none in my mind,'' he said. ``I can't be stronger in saying I don't 
consider it a possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn 
from Salt Lake City. '' Salt Lake organizers have denied that the 
bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC 
members' support in the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 
Winter Games. Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, 
when the program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, 
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting. From 1991 to 1995, the bid 
committee _ under the direction of former president Thomas Welch _ 
spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six 
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Olympic rules 
prohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or their relatives 
any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs 150. ``I've already 
stated I do not regard what was done as a bribe,'' Joklik said Friday. 
``I recognize there have been perceptions contrary to that. I regret 
those perceptions, but I don't feel they are justified.'' Joklik was 
chairman of the bid committee at the time, the No. 2 official behind 
Welch. Welch resigned last year as president of the organizing committee 
after being accused of domestic violence against his wife. He currently 
serves as a SLOC consultant. ``The organizing committee certainly 
has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any 
investigation,'' Joklik said. ``The facts were in the early 1990s 
when the bid committee was operating.'' Among those identified as 
receiving scholarship funds was Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the 
late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, 
was the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
