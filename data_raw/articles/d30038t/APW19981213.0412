Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might 
be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations 
of corruption within the Olympic movement. Asked whether he might 
resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. 
You never know.'' Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said 
he has since been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
His comments came as the leader of the Salt Lake organizing committee 
apologized Sunday for the alleged rules violations during the city's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC, meanwhile, said 
it was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery 
in the selection of Olympic host cities. Frank Joklik, 4th graf pvs
