A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread 
Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver 
votes in the selection of host cities. Marc Hodler, a senior member 
of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices 
in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 
2002 Salt Lake Games. Hodler said a group of four agents, including 
one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. 
He declined to identify them. ``The four agents try to make a living 
out of this,'' he said. ``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some 
of the agents do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that 
number of votes.' ``The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 
1 million for a number of votes, a bloc.'' Hodler added that the agents 
then charge the city winning the bid ``something like dlrs 3 million 
to dlrs 5 millon.'' Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there 
is one agent who boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games 
without his help.'' ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's 
allegations. ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board 
is (director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the 
other comments are personal comments. They are not official comments.'' 
Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the IOC 
continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the 
Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler 
has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set 
up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members. 
It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic 
bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes. Bruce 
Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he refused. Asked 
whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games was clean, 
Hodler said, ``Certainly not.' Asked whether Sydney's election was 
clean, he said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I 
don't want to disclose it.'' ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different 
from the others,'' he said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, 
clean, clean.'' Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt 
Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the 
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former 
bid chief Thomas Welch. ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, 
`Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. 
We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.'' The controversy 
centers on scholarships _ including tuition assistance and athlete 
training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake 
bid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction 
of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals 
_ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. The current 
SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the bid committee at 
the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was also a high official 
on the bid committee.
