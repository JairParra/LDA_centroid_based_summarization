Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In 
the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, 
leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many 
nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or 
food. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three 
days without food. Residents feared more children would die. ``The 
worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The children are 
suffering, even dying,'' said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the 
parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua 
on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center 
in Atlanta announced. ``We hope this visit will help call attention 
to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' 
Carter said in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested 
a ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. 
emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation 
next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver 
some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and 
Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan 
said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among 
a dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claims 
is a breakaway province. Two British ships that were in the area on 
an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, 
the Defense Ministry said Friday. ``It's a coincidence that the ships 
are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work 
in an organized way,'' said International Development Secretary Clare 
Short. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors 
as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters 
and with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused 
Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to 
transport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, 
who maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 
rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration.
