Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) 
area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. 
That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, 
Bolanos said.
