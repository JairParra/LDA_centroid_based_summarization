In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador _ where 140 people 
died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as 
did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. 
Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) 
and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved 
back out to sea.
