Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds 
and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. 
``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy 
because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two 
people who have died in it before,'' said Australian Maritime Safety 
Authority spokesman David Gray. The two dead were found on the 40-foot 
vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the 
New South Wales state town of Merimbula. Gray said Business Post Naiad 
owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs 
were killed. Both men were from Launceston in northern Tasmania. Guy 
suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht 
rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free 
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the 
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as possible. 
Race officials said Guy sailed in two previous Sydney to Hobart yacht 
races. Grave fears were held for the safety of the nine crew on missing 
cutter Winston Churchill, while contact has been lost with the five 
crew aboard Solo Globe. British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off 
the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas. 
At 12:30 p.m. local time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing 
for about 17 hours. Race officials said Charles had sailed in four 
Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 
Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th. Race spokesman Peter Campbell 
said it was not known how long Gray could survive in the water. ``It's 
supposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 
hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe 
conditions.'' Gray said about 56 sailors had been winched to safety. 
``There's just many many injuries on those yachts that got knocked 
down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,'' Gray said. 
``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got pounded 
yesterday.'' One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning 
Monday and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales 
coast. The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel 
was sailing unassisted. American John Campbell was rescued by a police 
helicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 
35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. Campbell was in the 
water for about 40 minutes and had hypothermia when he was taken to 
safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells 
to secure Campbell. ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United 
States television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I 
was going to survive.'' ``(Barclay) came down into the water only 
about 5, 10 feet away from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just 
threw my arms into the harness and they hoisted me up.'' At least 
37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. 
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in Bass 
Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 
115-boat fleet. The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last 
year's winner, Brindabella. Although the two were forced to reduce 
sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record of 
2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds, set by German maxi Morning 
Glory in 1996.
