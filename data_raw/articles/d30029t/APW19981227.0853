Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart 
race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts 
missing. The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel 
Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New South 
Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue 
Coordination Center in Canberra. Seven others on board were taken 
to a hospital by helicopter, the center said. The center was unable 
to identify the sailors, say how they died or give details on the 
injuries sustained by surviving crewmen. One of the missing yachts 
_ B-52 _ was found mid-morning Monday and was making its way toward 
Eden on the New South Wales coast, AusSAR said. The nine crew on board 
were thought to be safe and the vessel was sailing unassisted. With 
winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 
meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the 
missing vessels. AusSAR said no word had been received on the fate 
of the Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword 
of Orion on Sunday night. As of mid-morning Monday, he had been in 
the water for 15 hours. The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway 
across Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter 
with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and 
the frigate HMAS Newcastle was on its way to the area. The missing 
boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which sailed in the inaugural 
1945 race and Solo Globe Challenger. Despite the conditions, Race 
spokesman Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called 
off. ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole responsibility 
of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the 
race or retires,'' he said. A total of 37 yachts have been forced 
out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. Many lost their masts 
or have injured crew.
