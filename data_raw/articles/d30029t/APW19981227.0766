Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue 
resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force 
winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet. A helicopter 
rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles off the far south 
New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday morning. Two crew found 
dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad were left 
behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard the helicopter and 
flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said. The deaths were confirmed by 
an Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra 
a short time later. Neither organization was able to say how the sailors 
died or give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen. 
Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept 
off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on Sunday 
night. The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which 
sailed in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52 and Solo Globe Challenger. 
A major search involving Australia's navy continued Monday morning 
for those missing. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known 
how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water. ``It's 
supposition. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and 
that was in the middle of the night in very severe conditions,'' Campbell 
said. Despite the horrendous conditions it was unlikely the race would 
be called off, he said. ``It does say in the instructions that it 
is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide 
whether he continues in the race or retires,'' he said. The Australian 
Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has alerted all shipping in Bass 
Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 
115-boat fleet. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 
30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy seas near 
Gabo Island about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne. Several 
crewmen were injured including one with a broken leg. The yacht, which 
has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. 
The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking 
equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS Newcastle was on 
its way to the area. Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas 
of 35 feet caused havoc to the fleet, several rescues took place. 
A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian 
yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south 
of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 
40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched 
to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large 
swells to secure Campbell. A total of 37 yachts have been forced to 
retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted 
or suffering injuries to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara was 
narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. Although the 
two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well 
inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 days, 14 
hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by German maxi Morning Glory 
in 1996. (djp)
