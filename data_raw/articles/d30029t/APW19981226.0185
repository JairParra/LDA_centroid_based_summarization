Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked 
in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday 
as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather. All three 
maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning 
report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay 
on the New South Wales south coast. American maxi Sayonara and Sydney 
boat Brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometers (30 miles) 
offshore while Marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore. 
In fourth spot was Australian maxi Wild Thing. The three leaders covered 
105 nautical miles in the first 7 1-2 hours of the race. Propelled 
for the most part by favorable northerly breezes, the leaders rocketed 
along at an average speed of 14 knots in the first part of the 630-nautical-mile 
race to Hobart on the island state of Tasmania. The fast early pace 
put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse Morning Glory's 1996 race 
record but that was before the far tougher conditions forecast for 
overnight Saturday night. Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 
21-year-old race record two years ago, arriving in Hobart 2 days, 
14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds after she left Sydney. While 
the annual event started in friendly and favorable northeasterly breezes, 
the 115-strong fleet reported cloudier conditions as it moved down 
the coast. The yachts were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorms 
predicted ahead of a west-southwesterly change expected to lash the 
south coast by Sunday morning. Earlier, a crowd of around 300,000 
people on the Sydney headlands and water witnessed the start of the 
annual blue water classic. Sayonara took the initial honors when she 
beat Brindabella though Sydney heads, but the 1997 line honors winner 
drew level when the American maxi's spinnaker blew out and had to 
be replaced.
