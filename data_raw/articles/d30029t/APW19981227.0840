Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart 
race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts 
missing. The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel 
Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New South 
Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue 
Coordination Center in Canberra. Seven others on board were taken 
to a hospital by helicopter, the center said. The center was unable 
to identify the sailors, say how they died or give details on the 
injuries sustained by surviving crewmen. With winds gusting to 90 
mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 meters), the race continued 
even as rescue teams searched for the missing vessels. There was no 
sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the 30-foot (9-meter) 
boat rolled in wild seas Sunday night near Gabo Island, about 280 
miles (450 kilometers) east of Melbourne. The yacht, which has a crew 
of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. Race spokesman 
Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor could survive 
in the water. The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, 
which sailed in the inaugural 1945 race; B-52; and Solo Globe Challenger. 
Despite the conditions, Campbell said it was unlikely the race would 
be called off. ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole 
responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues 
in the race or retires,'' he said. A total of 37 yachts have been 
forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. Many lost their 
masts or have injured crew.
