A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast 
coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during 
the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority 
(AMSA) said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds 
and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. The Australian 
Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking 
equipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle 
into the area Monday morning morning from Sydney. An AMSA spokesman 
said they were alerted that the 13-meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion 
had been rolled in the heavy seas, with several crewmen being injured, 
including the unidentified man lost overboard. Another crewman has 
a broken leg. The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across 
Bass Strait heading towards Hobart, capital of the island state of 
Tasmania and the finish line in the annual race. The ANSA spokesman 
said search conditions were ``atrocious.'' Earlier, as winds gusting 
to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused havoc to the fleet, several 
rescues took place. A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept 
overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge 
seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, 
was in the water for about 40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia 
when he was winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who 
dropped into 20-foot seas to secure Campbell. The Victorian state 
police Air Wing used an infra-red night vision system to find Campbell 
and the Navy Sea King is using the same equipment to try to find the 
man lost from Sword of Orion. Another helicopter lifted the entire 
crew of 12 from the dismasted VC Offshore Stand Aside. Several crew 
members were injured in the dismasting, with one losing several fingers 
and another suffering head injuries. A total of 37 yachts have been 
forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been 
dismasted or suffering injuries to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi 
Sayonara is narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. 
Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were 
still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 
2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by German maxi 
Morning Glory in 1996. (djp)
