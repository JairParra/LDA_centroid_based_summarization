A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert 
Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him 
running against Newt Gingrich as speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign 
has given some members pause about ousting him. At the same time, 
a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not 
vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because 
of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in 
knots for months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally 
have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker 
in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the 
same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock 
the vote.'' Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, 
when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House. They 
blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were already 
angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear 
message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget 
process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted 
Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive 
amounts of spending for local projects. House Republicans are to meet 
Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. Whoever wins the 
Republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full 
House in January. Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could 
be denied re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least 
five others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control 
the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich 
to deny him a majority. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect 
looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the 
good of the party, Republican officials said. The officials said that 
Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but 
also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure 
with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans said 
that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee 
and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, 
and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for 
votes. Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, 
but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce 
his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined 
if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., was one of several members 
who spoke with Livingston on Thursday. ``He told me he's making a 
number of phone calls, that he's gotten a very positive response about 
running for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours,'' 
King said. ``He won't do it till he has his ducks in a row, and right 
now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide 
to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line 
between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement 
to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party. Many Republicans 
immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday. Talk 
quickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose Gingrich 
and his lieutenants. The list of possible candidates for leadership 
positions included Rep.e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with 
Livingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich, Republican officials 
said, speaking on the condition that their names not be reported. 
Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted to 
run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, 
the majority leader. But, these officials said that if Livingston 
did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead. 
Other names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts. They included 
Reps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington 
as conference chairman. Added to the mix on Thursday was the name 
of Rep. Christopher Cox, a California conservative. As a sign of the 
uncertainty prevailing among House members on Thursday, Rep. Henry 
Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House's 
most venerable members, rebuffed a chance to endorse Gingrich as speaker. 
Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's losses 
Tuesday. ``Leadership takes credit when things go right,'' he said. 
``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.'' Asked if Gingrich 
should remain speaker, Hyde said: ``I rather think he will, but that 
remains to be seen.'' The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday 
as anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal 
political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in toppling 
Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him as 
a veteran who understands the House and has shown shrewd political 
skills in managing the massive federal budget, others are reviving 
images of the Louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name 
during the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward 
arm-flailing in heated moments. One conservative leader said that 
he and his allies had reservations about Livingston because he was 
``obsessed'' about trying to keep social issues out of the budget 
process. The budget, he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives 
over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and 
other things you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential 
veto. If Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying 
of the real conservatives in Congress.'' Some moderates said they 
were prepared to support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``I 
would be amenable to Livingston.'' Still, she cautioned, ``I'm not 
after Newt. But it's wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our 
options.'' Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., 
said that his boss was ``emblematic'' of the confusion among the broad 
base of House Republicans. ``Billy has been loyal to both Speaker 
Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal to them, but he also 
wants to hear what they have to say before committing to them in the 
next election,'' Johnson said. ``Everyone is asking the same question: 
Can we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning 
the leadership?'' Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter 
what was based on Gingrich's track record of ``one failed strategy 
after another,'' including the impeachment process and the pork-laden 
budget. With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to 
show members that he is responsive to their concerns. After an election 
night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as 
they lost seats, the next day he took ``responsibility'' for the losses. 
In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede 
control over the party's congressional campaign committee, allowing 
the whole House to select its members. Gingrich is also making strong 
personal appeals to Republicans. Said one top House aide: ``He'll 
get support. How much? Only his own vote-counters know.''
