House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution 
of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President 
Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned 
on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections. 
Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich 
announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans 
that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote 
and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. 
``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in 
the system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party aide who listened 
to one of the calls. Gingrich's resignation was a stunning reversal 
for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians 
in America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one Democratic 
speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style through Tuesday's 
elections with last-minute commercials reminding voters of the Clinton 
scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday 
night. In his second conference call, according to several people 
who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall. 
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control 
of Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter critics in the 
last two years of his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he called 
them cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into quitting. Rep. Michael 
P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who had marginalized 
the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism. He said, `Refer to 
the clips.' He's blaming others.'' Another Republican described the 
conference call this way: ``He started off very statesmanlike, but 
then you could see the anger building. When someone asked him why 
he was leaving, he said, `A handful of members have blackmailed the 
conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.''' 
Gingrich announced his move just hours after Rep. Robert L. Livingston 
of Louisiana announced he was running for speaker, putting himself 
forward as a pragmatist and a manager. After the Gingrich calls, Rep. 
Bill Archer of Texas announced he was considering his own run for 
speaker. Livingston and Archer are chairmen of the two most powerful 
committees in the House. In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican 
conference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' 
He said he hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both 
reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively.'' 
Referring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning from 
Congress because ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off to get 
to know each other again.'' He also acknowledged his own knack for 
bringing negative attention to himself and his party. ``If I stay,'' 
he told his colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would 
overshadow any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those 
who recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown 
of the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the 
back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton. According 
to another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of his resignation: 
``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members. So long 
as I am around, I will always be a target in the news media, which 
would mean we would never be able to get our message out.'' Clinton 
said: ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican 
Party to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national 
debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. Despite 
our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were able to 
work together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's 
strong support for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace 
and prosperity in the world.'' Many Republicans took the opportunity 
to portray Gingrich as a visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New 
York said that during the first conference call, ``there was shock 
and surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for leading us 
to the Promised Land.'' His supporters said Gingrich had the votes 
to win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted 
by secret ballot. But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority 
meant every vote would be a battle. Kenneth Duberstein, a former official 
in the Reagan administration, said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes 
to be speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said 
that because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not have 
been able to implement his plans. In an unusually biting reaction, 
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped 
that Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that 
he had fostered. ``I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker 
will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was 
wrought on this institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt said. 
House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set 
off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had 
been anticipated. ``There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne 
who will test the waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich 
for re-election as speaker. ``There won't be any shortage of candidates.''
