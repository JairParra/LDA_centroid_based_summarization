This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do well. The planning. The 
strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought the GOP 
to the majority in Congress in 1994 and made him the first Republican 
House Speaker in 40 years. But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision 
seems to have blurred this time around, costing Republicans a net 
of five seats in Tuesday's election and leaving the party's narrow 
governing majority even narrower. The disappointing election results 
also left Gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post as speaker. 
Members and aides said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled 
up overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate 
of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House 
Republicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year. 
As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, ``When a company's stock price 
goes down, it's usually the CEO who gets fired.'' Top Republican aides, 
speaking anonymously, were even blunter. ``People were very angry 
last night,'' one aide said. ``Today it's a mixture of seething and 
dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt knows it. His career is on the line.'' 
Another aide said, ``Most people are really angry with Newt, and no 
one knows what to do with it. But some are dipping their toe in the 
water and seeing what the temperature is.'' A possible slate could 
contain the names of Reps. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana to replace 
Gingrich, Steve Largent of Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas 
as majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John 
A. Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh 
of Indiana is also said to be considering a run for speaker, but it 
was not clear whether he would be part of any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay 
of Texas, the majority whip, was said to be secure. Armey bluntly 
acknowledged the scramble going on in the wings to oust the leadership. 
Told on ``Nightline'' that there were Republicans after his head, 
Armey replied: ``They're welcome to it if they're big enough to take 
it.'' Publicly, Gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his 
job as speaker. But he has been grim-faced over the last 24 hours 
and closeted himself Wednesday with his top strategists making calls 
to shore up his support among members. ``He looks like the victim 
of an accident,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who supports Gingrich. 
``He's very somber in tone.'' The question, as it always is with Gingrich, 
is how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership. 
In the past, no more than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed 
their dissatisfaction with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzled 
for lack of support. ``I'm hoping more people will understand the 
need for a serious reassessment this year,'' said Rep. Charles T. 
Canady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker 
after the 1996 elections, when the Republicans also lost seats. ``The 
reality is this: Our majority keeps shrinking,'' Canady said. ``If 
it shrinks any more, it will be gone.'' But Gingrich has built support 
among moderates, and some perceived the election as a repudiation 
of the conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said the 
results showed that this was the right direction for the party. ``To 
maintain our majority, we've got to moderate some of our views,'' 
Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings 
Institution, said that moderates supported Gingrich in part because 
no appealing alternative had emerged. ``They know he sees the broader 
world and is prepared to moderate if it makes sense,'' Mann said. 
``Newt's gone out of his way to support the moderates. He's nurtured 
a relationship with them.'' But Mann and others said that anger has 
been building at Gingrich for several reasons, including his signing 
on to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to President 
Clinton, not offering a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and 
not communicating a clear political message. ``We are most defined 
by who we hate'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. ``But voters are more 
sophisticated than that, and Republicans better have something to 
say about where we're going.'' The anger grew in the last few days 
when the speaker approved a $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign 
that allowed Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, 
who has never been nearly as popular with the public as Clinton has 
been. As if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss, the 
speaker seemed unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning 
to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the 
House. As late as Tuesday afternoon, he was predicting a net pickup 
of between 10 and 30. ``Until we look at it better, I frankly don't 
understand all the things that happened yesterday,'' he said, ``and 
I'm not sure anybody else in the country does either.'' But he said 
Republicans should have ``maniacally focused'' on a basic message 
of cutting taxes, saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse, 
and campaigned aggressively on those themes. He contrasted the lack 
of focus this year with the Contract With America that proved so successful 
in 1994. ``People thought we stood for something pretty big,'' he 
said. But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about 
his leadership, repeatedly casting the election results as a victory 
for his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the majority 
for three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years. He also 
suggested that those who would challenge him have little support. 
``The people who normally are quoted on this are people who would 
in fact take the party to a narrower base,'' Gingrich said, referring 
to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his 
leadership. ``I'd like to see who it was that had a plan that they 
were confident over the last 60 days would have been more successful 
and why they didn't share it.''
