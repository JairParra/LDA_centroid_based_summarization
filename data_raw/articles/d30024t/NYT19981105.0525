Just four years ago, it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be 
the pivotal figure in U.S. politics at the turn of the millennium. 
Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned 
it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With a promise to 
balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social 
values, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress 
just as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency. But Gingrich's 
leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the 
speaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization. A change this 
dramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation 
about election tactics. What looked like one of the major realignments 
in U.S. political history might turn out to have been nothing but 
a temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a 
revolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceived 
as a Democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and 
a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big 
deficits. They were the same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited 
so successfully. But old political habits and a moribund Republican 
leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout 
the 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined 
tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps. 
Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for political 
organization finally took Reagan's formula for success to the congressional 
elections in 1994. But once in power, he ran head on into Bill Clinton, 
whose political instincts were even better. The president co-opted 
parts of the Contract With America, particularly the balanced budget 
and welfare reform. He adapted the Republican social message into 
a call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems, 
which symbolized more responsibility and parental control without 
supporting government intrusion into private lives. The Republican 
right's genuine contempt for Clinton was based in part on the well-known 
flaws in the president's character. But it was mainly a reaction to 
the ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood 
tide of their revolution. They expected that the genuine successes 
of Gingrich's first year in office would lead to still larger victories 
for minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and a 
return to conservative Christian values. But the public was happy 
to be led in another direction, and focus on the concerns of aging 
baby boomers about health care and Social Security. The government 
that was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again 
looked like a potential ally. Back in 1994, both parties were so stunned 
by the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may 
have overestimated what it all meant. In particular they may not have 
realized how quickly good economic times, a drop in crime and national 
welfare reform could blunt the power of race in U.S. politics. The 
Democrats had become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully 
identified their policies with cities, blacks and immigrants. But 
last week union workers and Catholics returned to the Democratic fold. 
Without race as a wedge issue, the solid black Democratic vote became 
a powerful advantage in key states. Blacks, women and Latinos angry 
at Republican anti-immigration initiatives were the winning coalition 
in California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker was right 
to say this was ``not the election we expected.'' There may indeed 
be a Republican majority in America, but it appears to resemble the 
Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich _ pro-business, 
wary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bringing up messy social 
issues like abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking about 
``compassionate conservatism'' and ``the politics of inclusion'' may 
be peddling political mush, but they peddled it to victory on Tuesday. 
The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the wilderness 
of the House minority may have left it too accustomed to opposition 
to figure out what it can be for, and too attached to the politics 
of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation. Gingrich 
has suggested that his mistake was to let the Republicans drift along 
on the politics of impeachment when they should have been ``almost 
maniacally focused'' on things like tax cuts. But looking maniacal 
is what got them into trouble in the first place. Winning control 
of Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 1994. 
But it will be ten times tougher to forge a politics that does not 
depend on rage.
