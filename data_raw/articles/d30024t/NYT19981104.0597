Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional 
Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for 
their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an 
off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility 
of congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results 
showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold 
over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the 
House. The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that 
the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and 
it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. 
The Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political 
year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming 
a Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, 
amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled 
Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until 
they captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the 
House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry 
Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday 
that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the 
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers 
he hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment 
by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands 
and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday 
until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying to put 
the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, 
Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections 
in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious 
rank and file Republicans burned up the phone lines to each other, 
discussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers 
in the next few weeks. ``We've got to reach out and have more than 
southern white males running the Washington Republican Party,'' said 
Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans 
this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We 
need an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire calendar 
year without an agenda.'' Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut 
called the election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are 
going to be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party 
want to see change.'' At the White House, Clinton called the election 
results a vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all 
the results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American 
people want their business, their concerns, their children, their 
families, their future addressed here. That's what the message of 
the election was.'' One of the first difficult questions now facing 
Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face 
of public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican 
majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes 
required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement 
released Wednesday, Hyde said ``The Committee continues to have a 
clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious 
manner. Our duty has not changed because the constitution has not 
changed.'' But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results 
guaranteed that impeachment will fail. ``I think any serious effort 
to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he 
said. ``It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on 
an exit strategy.'' From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, 
a Long Island Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up 
expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate 
future.'' For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control 
of the House with 228 seats and to find consensus among their party's 
competing factions. With their numbers reduced, the Republican leadership 
will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core 
conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with 
a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. 
The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held by an indepenndent. 
Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The 
new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate 
Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking control away 
from Republican leaders. Already seeing some of the possibilities, 
Rep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans 
would be strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership 
and makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said. ``It's going to 
weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast 
conservatives.'' Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election 
gains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically 
uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the results. 
``Things were happening out there that none of us fully understand--neither 
party in my judgment,'' he said. Taking his share of the blame for 
his party's losses, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how 
the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the 
modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican 
themes. ``I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people 
would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio 
and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of 
disgusting by sheer repetition,'' he said. ``And as a result I think 
we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a 
much stronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security, 
winning the war on drugs, reforming education and national defense.'' 
Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes, 
saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final 
96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble 
to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. ``One of this lessons 
for Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully 
to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise 
message that we do apply across the nation,'' he said in Washington. 
Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next 
year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. Even 
as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were 
making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against 
the Republican leaders who have steered the Congress since the Republican's 
assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said 
the House had become a ``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, 
``The long distance charges in Washington offices probably are going 
through the roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes 
that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans 
when Republican governors are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts, 
Florida and Texas.'' And while Gingrich has not gone out of his way 
to identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad 
blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. 
Gingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt 
against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership 
team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. 
But with House leadership elections now set for mid-November, Republicans 
said this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological 
lines to moderates like Shays as well. ``We got shellacked,'' said 
Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves 
because we had no agenda.'' Republicans were discussing possible challenges 
to Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members 
of the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run 
an entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations 
Committee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, 
an Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results 
could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly 
concerned.'' Republicans close to him said they expected the anger 
to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in 
early December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges 
against mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular 
pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of 
Kentucky, who poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying 
to defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmakers 
on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he 
would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than 
eight senators, and was considering whether to challenge McConnell. 
Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. 
``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a very historic 
opportunity last night. To just break even is a loss.'' Most incumbents 
coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. 
Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, 
Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of 
New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his 
re-election bid _ Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members 
include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat 
was leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House 
seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement was not expected 
until Friday after absentee ballots are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed 
``revolutionaries'' of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly 
elected members are career politicians who rose through the ranks 
of local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the sons 
of former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who 
represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall 
brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, 
and Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his father, Henry.
