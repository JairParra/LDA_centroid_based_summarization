A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers 
into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's 
second-largest city. Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed 
off that figure Friday evening. ''The earlier information that police 
gave out was wrong,'' Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, 
told a news conference. The fast-spreading fire that broke out just 
a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left 
rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart 
Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been 
determined as of Friday evening. Although an estimated 400 people, 
most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, 
the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson. 
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant 
group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20 people 
died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas. Police said most 
victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were 
found at the scene and one other died later. Of the injured, at least 
57 were in intensive care, according to Sven Martinell, spokesman 
for the local medical authorities. The building did not have sprinklers 
and was not required to have them, officials said. The dance was attended 
mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants. Police said the dead 
or injured represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis, 
Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, along with people from current 
and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries. The 
Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building, had in 
turn rented the facility out to others for the dance, Carlsson said. 
That person was not immdiately identified. Binan Atta was walking 
to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. He said he raced 
in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. ``His 
clothes had burned off. His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said. 
``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran 
Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. 
``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They didn't even 
look down'' beforehand. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. 
(2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes 
later, rescue workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building. 
The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, 
city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by the 
Swedish news agency TT. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman 
Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and 
other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. 
Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been set. 
``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal 
fire,'' he said. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest 
of the capital, Stockholm. The crowd in the second story of the building 
contained mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday 
weekend. ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave 
from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally 
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' 
the Goteborg city council said in a statement. ``Goteborg is today 
a city in shock.'' Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire 
site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. 
Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the 
blaze started with about 400 people inside. ``It looked like it started 
in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he 
was quoted as saying. ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get 
out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... 
Others kicked out the windows and jumped out.'' Ambulances were called 
in from several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also 
brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. Anna-Lisa 
Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims 
were taken, said identifying many of them was difficult. ``Maybe you 
have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ... They maybe don't 
have their own identification, but have that of a friend who is a 
year older. Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in 
a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,'' she said, according 
to TT. Goteborg has about 435,000 people.
