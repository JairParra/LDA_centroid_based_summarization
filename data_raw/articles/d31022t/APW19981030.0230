A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween 
revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring 
about 180. ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local 
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing 
the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a 
city of half a million people on the country's west coast. The fire 
was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people 
died in the town of Boraas. ``We are still searching the building 
... but so far we have found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan 
Edmundson said on national radio. At a news conference Friday morning, 
police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. 
The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people 
who needed treatment at emergency burn centers. Binan Atta was walking 
to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. He said he raced 
in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. ``His 
clothes had burned off. His skin was red and bubbly,'' Atta said. 
``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran 
Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. 
``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They didn't even 
look down'' beforehand. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. 
(2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes 
later, rescue workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story 
brick building. The dance was on the second floor. About 300 or 400 
people were inside, police said. Many escaped on their own. Police 
rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th victim died at a hospital. 
``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with 
youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling 
with police to get in and attempt to help friends. The cause of the 
fire was not immediately known. ``What we know is that there was an 
explosion,'' Edmundson said. Olin said there were signs that the fire 
was set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not 
a normal fire,'' he said. The Swedish news agency TT reported 190 
people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in 
intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter 
to burn clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about 
500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. The 
fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the 
local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance. The crowd 
in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year 
olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. ``A night full of 
expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits 
in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into 
a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council 
said in a statement. ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.'' Jamal 
Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze 
started with about 400 people inside. ``It looked like it started 
in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he 
was quoted as saying. ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get 
out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... 
Others kicked out the windows and jumped out.'' Ambulances were called 
in from several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also 
brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. Olin 
said the rescue service inspected the building in April 1997 and ``fulfilled 
all possible demands as far as emergency exits and the possibility 
for fast evacuation.'' Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, 
where many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them 
was difficult. ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they 
are ... They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that 
of a friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification 
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,'' 
she said, according to TT. Goteborg has about 435,000 people.
