In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials broke 
their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent 
dissident who was trying to form an opposition political party. ``Xu 
Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national 
security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the People's 
Republic of China,'' said a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which 
on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest. The sudden arrest on 
Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with 
him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests 
from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington. 
``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms 
guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a serious 
step in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. U.S. officials in Beijing urged 
the government to release Xu and asked for clarification as to the 
exact nature of his crime. China signed the International Covenant 
of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's 
arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment 
to its tenets. Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, 
with more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that 
they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the 
China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home 
in Wuhan on Monday. Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese 
government protesting the detentions, said the Information Center 
for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Three other 
Democratic Party organizers were also detained on Monday, although 
two of them were released early Wednesday. But the two more prominent 
dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely to face a much longer haul since 
both have been charged with ``criminal acts.'' Xu's wife, He Xintong, 
said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific 
charge against her husband, although she surmised from the aggressive 
behavior of the arresting officers that the sentence ``could be long.'' 
Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to subvert 
the government,'' a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences 
of three years to life. In the Chinese criminal code, this charge 
comes under a grab-bag section called ``threatening state security,'' 
which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers 
the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent 
activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to 
``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.'' Xu's 
and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts to gain 
recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy 
activists in more than a dozen cities around China that was formed 
this year. In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive 
and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, 
submitting repeated applications even after local authorities had 
declared the concept of an opposition party illegal. They say the 
Chinese Constitution does not specifically forbid the formation of 
new political parties, although there have been no new parties since 
the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. In fact, the by-laws 
of the China Democratic Party are fairly tame; they carefully acknowledge 
the central role of the Communist Party, but also support free speech 
and free elections for public officials. ``My husband thought the 
time was right to begin working to form a new party, since China recently 
signed the covenant on human rights,'' Ms. He said. In September, 
a few Democratic Party members got some slightly encouraging signals 
from local governments, which initially accepted their applications 
to form a social organization to develop a party. But in recent weeks, 
as organizers like Xu became more insistent and defiant, harassment 
by the police increased. ``All this past week we felt something was 
going to happen,'' Ms. He said. ``It seemed that anyone who came to 
visit us was later detained for a while. And there have been a lot 
more cars from the Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual.''
