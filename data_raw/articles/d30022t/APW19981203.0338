China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested 
this week are suspected of endangering national security _ the clearest 
sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws 
were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state. 
A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been 
in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the 
overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center 
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. All three 
men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures 
under China's vague state security law. The ruling Communist Party 
has resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect 
last year. The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and 
the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese 
leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally 
register the China Democracy Party in June. Xu and Qin were ``suspected 
of involvement in activities endangering state security'' and their 
``behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the 
People's Republic of China,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing. 
Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charges 
have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a step closer 
to trial, the Information Center said. Xu and Qin are influential 
figures in the dissident community, having started their campaign 
for change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang 
was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. 
Both have served time in prison. Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of 
it in solitary confinement. Since dissidents began organizing and 
trying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have 
harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until 
now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations. 
The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form 
since it took power in 1949. In Washington on Wednesday, White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests 
and said the dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental 
human rights that all governments should protect. U.S. officials conveyed 
their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged 
that Xu and Qin be released immediately. Zhu criticized the United 
States for condemning the arrests, saying that ``no country, including 
the United States, should interfere in China's internal affairs.'' 
China in October signed a key U.N. treaty on civil and political rights 
that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association. 
It was the 17th international human rights treaty China has signed. 
Zhu told reporters there was ``absolutely no contradiction at all'' 
between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the 
two dissidents.
