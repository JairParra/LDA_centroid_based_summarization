China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy 
campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents 
to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday. 
Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo to 
stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring the 
warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon 
and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,'' Zha 
said. Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested 
Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest 
blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy 
Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. 
Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a crime 
that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party advocate, 
Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also formally arrested 
Monday although his family has not been informed of the charges. Zha, 
who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing and the nearby 
port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's arrest was ordered 
by the central government, not Beijing police. He took the police 
reference to ``reactionary groups'' to mean exiled dissidents in the 
United States. Under China's vague State Security Law, such links 
may also be punishable by up to life in prison. Zha pledged to work 
with dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign 
``to save Xu Wenli.'' On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the 
country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, 
Qin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human 
rights treaties China has signed over the past 14 months. The authorities 
``are deceiving and cheating international public opinion while on 
the other hand they are suppressing and persecuting domestic political 
dissidents,'' said the letter faxed to foreign news agencies. In Washington, 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored 
the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin. ``We believe the peaceful 
political activities of this kind and other forms of peaceful expression 
that they've been involved in are fundamental human rights that should 
be protected by all governments,'' Lockart said. ``We call on the 
Chinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr. 
Xu and Mr. Qin.'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. 
officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and urged that Xu be released immediately. U.S. officials 
received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being detained on suspicion 
of ``having conducted activities damaging to China's national security,'' 
Rubin said. He said he had no information from Chinese authorities 
about Qin or Wang. Two other democracy party supporters taken into 
custody in central Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao 
Shichang _ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's 
wife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party as 
well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations. Qin and Xu are 
towering figures in China's persecuted dissident community. Their 
activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the 1970s. 
Wang was a student leader in 1989's influential Tiananmen Square democracy 
movement. All have spent time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of 
it in solitary confinement. Xu's wife said she does not know where 
he is being held and, in her 20-year experience with the authorities, 
believes they are unlikely to tell her. Released in 1993, Xu picked 
up his campaigning for political change soon after his parole ended 
last year. He has tried to use China's nascent legal system and the 
international treaties it signed to push for reform. ``My husband 
is innocent and there's nothing he can be criticized for,'' said his 
wife, He Xintong. ``They're going to have to expend a lot of effort 
to make him a criminal.''
