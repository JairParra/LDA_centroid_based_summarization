Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by 
dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's 
activities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday. Police 
in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday 
afternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the 
group's members, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China. Police wanted a list of members with their work 
and home addresses, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them 
into trouble, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. Corruption 
Watch, founded by nine dissidents in seven provinces, now has nearly 
100 members, the center said. It applied last month to the government 
to register officially, but received no response, the center added. 
The police officers who questioned An Jun said that without official 
permission, the group must cease its activities, the center said. 
Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China. The 
Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports 
of graft in its first month of operation. In a separate report, the 
center said that an official in the Sichuan provincial government 
refused Thursday to accept an application by three dissidents to form 
a branch of a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party. 
Groups of dissidents in cities across China have attempted to register 
the group, as required by law, but authorities have rejected those 
applications. Signaling that the Communist Party's 49-year-old ban 
on opposition groups remains intact, police have detained and questioned 
many dissidents associated with the group.
