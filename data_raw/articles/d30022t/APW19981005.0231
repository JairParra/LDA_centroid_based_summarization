Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty 
and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent 
human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest 
run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in 
a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin said 
a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan 
accused him of engaging in illegal activities. The police came soon 
after he returned home. ``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan 
Public Security Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily 
scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters. 
Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three 
hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he 
persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin 
hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities 
don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting 
human rights to the last.'' China plans to sign the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. 
By the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on 
Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in 
seven years. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech 
and assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come 
into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations 
effectively nullifying some provisions. Blair has vowed to discuss 
differences over human rights with Chinese leaders. His visit has 
drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group 
urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners. 
In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leaders 
say they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the 
government allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands 
of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, 
labor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a copy of which 
was released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights 
and Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release 
of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political 
change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; 
and other imprisoned activists. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders 
urged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu 
Jingsheng. The three are among 13 journalists imprisoned ``simply 
for attempting to practice their profession,'' it said in a statement.
