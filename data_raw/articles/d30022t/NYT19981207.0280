One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 
17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite 
the subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given 
to his wife on Monday. The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, 
a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests 
how serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy 
the fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak 
out over the last year. The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that 
will almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence 
of five years or more. Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, 
Hangzhou in eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested 
until Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters 
of the new party, were detained. One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central 
city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being 
held on suspicion of subversive activities. Detailed charges have 
not been filed. Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations 
in Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement, 
Wang was arrested and served two years in prison. Qin and Xu became 
known as democracy advocates in the late 1970s. Qin was imprisoned 
for eight years. In 1993 he was put in a labor camp for two years. 
Xu spent 12 years in prison. When President Clinton visited in the 
spring, Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party. He and 
other dissidents hoped that China's new friendship with the United 
States and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and 
civil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives. 
After Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned and released, 
only to be re-arrested as authorities began what now appears to be 
a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, was 
handed the bill of prosecution, according to the Information Center 
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Wang is charged 
with helping draft a party manifesto that states, in part, ``Only 
by establishing an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism.'' 
That is cited as grounds for the subversion charge, the information 
center said. In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, 
the prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state 
abroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law. He used 
e-mail to send 18 copies of the party's founding documents abroad, 
met with a member of a subversive foreign organization and received 
money from foreign sources to buy a computer, the indictment reportedly 
says.
