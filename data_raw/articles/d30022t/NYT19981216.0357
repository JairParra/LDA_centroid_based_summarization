Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent 
dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, scheduled 
to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan. The defendant is 
Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison 
and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist 
political party. In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, 
Qin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand 
the court a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, 
he said he will walk out. ``I wouldn't be able to stand it,'' the 
father, a retired steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high 
blood pressure. Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant 
has the right to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin 
said, some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while 
others were warned by security officials not to get involved. The 
father said he did not agree with his son's political tactics but 
now he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment. Qin Yongmin 
was arrested on Nov. 30, only hours after his mother died of a stroke. 
``He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral,'' Qin Qinguo said. 
``And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer.'' On Thursday morning, 
a few hundred miles to the east in the city of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 
33, is to go on trial on similar charges of inciting subversion. He, 
too, has no defense lawyer. Wang was a leader of student demonstrations 
in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and served two years in prison after they 
were put down by military force. As the founder of the suppressed 
new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced 
its charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Scores 
of people around the country began to champion the new party, hopeful 
that closer ties between China and the United States, and China's 
signing of the international covenant on political and civil rights, 
would mean a looser political climate. But the party was soon declared 
illegal and many adherents were detained, at least temporarily. Wang 
now faces charges that could land him in prison for five years or 
more. A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu 
Wenli, has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected to face 
similar subversion charges. In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy 
Party members or supporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained 
by the police and others have had their phone lines cut, reported 
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in 
China, based in Hong Kong.
