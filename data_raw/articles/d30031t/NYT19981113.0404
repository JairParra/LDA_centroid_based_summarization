WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set 
aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space 
station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday. While 
putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station 
would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old 
outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, 
said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was 
surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed 
the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch 
of the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight 
by 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in 
the subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable 
sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. ``We have 
mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' 
Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center 
in Houston. ``It added technical complexity and risks to the mission 
that were not justified.'' The decision, which followed ``frank and 
candid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by 
the United States, he said. ``The conclusions were mutual,'' Brinkley 
said. ``Both sides concluded that it did not make sense.'' The Russians, 
struggling to find money for their space program with their nation 
in economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousands of 
pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an 
economy move. However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives, 
wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay 
the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have 
agreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the 
United States and other partners in the international station fear 
that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations 
with the new project. ``The Mir competes with the international space 
station for very critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said. 
NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to 
use on the international space station, he said, but only if it does 
not interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and 
15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next 
week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and 
propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. 
The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second 
station part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attaches to 
the first module.
