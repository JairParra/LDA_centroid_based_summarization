A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the 
space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international 
space station. Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts 
is scheduled for Friday at 3:36 a.m. This was the first time in three 
years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after 
the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to 
go. The uncommon delay prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although 
officials stressed that it was entirely warranted. ``We want to err 
on the conservative side,'' Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy 
Space Center, said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the 
countdown just 19 seconds before liftoff. Everything had been going 
smoothly for a rare nighttime launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday 
morning. The weather, forecast to be iffy, turned out to be fine, 
and the sky was alight with a nearly full moon. But the length of 
the so-called launching window was, as planned, unusually short _ 
only 10 minutes. That brevity was a result of Endeavour's having to 
rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last 
month. The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when 
the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm. Controllers 
studied the data and discovered a momentary pressure drop on one of 
the hydraulic systems that control the movements of the shuttle's 
engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces. Officials eventually 
decided that the pressure drop was insignificant, and they resolved 
to press ahead. But by then it was too late: time had run out for 
one of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold. 
So the countdown was aborted just 19 seconds from blastoff. The six 
astronauts began to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately 
headed for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday.
