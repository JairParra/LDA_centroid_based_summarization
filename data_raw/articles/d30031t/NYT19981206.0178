Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of 
the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined 
the first two of many segments that will form the international space 
station. The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya 
control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits 
throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles 
above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the 
Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder 
as the craft passed above Russia and to slowly pull it toward the 
shuttle. Seeing Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, 
the shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy 
from the module following its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. There 
were earlier indications that the antennas, which will be used later 
by the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings, had not extended. 
Currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above the 
American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's cargo bay. 
When the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another, Cabana 
fired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle, allowing the 
modules to clamp together. The two station pieces, together measuring 
about 77 feet from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 
pounds, are the first of 100 major components to be united in space 
over the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh 
almost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football 
fields. More than 40 additional missions by U.S. shuttles and Russian 
rockets will be used to haul all of the components and other supplies 
into orbit, and astronauts from both nations are to spend almost 1,800 
hours doing spacewalks to assemble the entire structure. The spece 
station is expected to cost its partnership of 16 nations more than 
$40 billion just to construct. Bringing the pieces together is only 
the first step in mating them. A pair of astronauts are to make three 
spacewalks this week, the first on Monday, during which they will 
hook up electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach 
handrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one 
unit. The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million 
Zarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after the 
shuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Currie had to use the Canadian-built 
robot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without being able to see 
where the pieces joined. Unity, raised in Endeavour's cargo bay on 
Saturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view of the mating 
fixtures from the shuttle's windows. She used views from remote cameras 
and a computerized vision system built on the arm to estimate the 
relative positions of the two large segments. The computerized system 
examined markings on both modules, computed their relationship to 
one another using the marks and displayed the results on a laptop 
computer. ``We've never done anything like this before,'' Currie said 
before the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult maneuver 
more than 100 times over the last two years. The flight of Endeavour, 
which took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according 
to plan until early Sunday, when mission control ordered the shuttle 
to change its orbit slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air 
Force space debris trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within 
1.6 miles of a spent stage of an American booster rocket launched 
last month. Although this was considered a safe distance, shuttle 
controllers decided to widen the separation to five miles as an extra 
precaution.
