The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle 
Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built 
part of an international space station that is expected to cost more 
than $100 billion. After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced 
a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 
Friday morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the 
moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly 
turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes 
and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen 
in the distance, twinkling like a new star. On their 12-day flight, 
Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, 
grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module. 
Wielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically 
in the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly 
that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great 
cathedrals look like child's play. Construction of the station, which 
will be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walks, 
which, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. When 
complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power 
arrays, will cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules 
of interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven 
astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. 
The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile. 
The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty 
of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, 
along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the 
construction site. The work is further complicated by international 
politics and worries about money. The Russians, whose participation 
in the partnership clinched the post-Cold War deal five years ago, 
are now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have left 
Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up 
with its share of money and technology. At the same time, the station's 
costs are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its 
appetite for money will consume their own federal financing. The project's 
total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates 
now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's 
estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers are 
to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners 
about $14 billion. The station is intended to be a grand laboratory 
where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop 
new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries, 
in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space 
flight to other worlds. Friday, in any case, little was heard about 
the project but praise. ``Great show, Endeavour,'' mission control 
in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into 
orbit. At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
lauded the launching team and the new venture. ``That was truly, truly 
fantastic,'' she told the team after the liftoff. And it was important, 
she added, to have so many nations ``working together on the kinds 
of issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with.'' ``So 
my congratulations to all of you,'' the secretary said. ``Stupendous 
work.'' The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built 
station part. Small compared with the giants to come in three dozen 
shuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet long, weighs 
13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules. Saturday, 
one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have 
the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure 
it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal 
to a vertical position. Then, Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous 
with the module known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched 
into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States 
but built in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is be a kind of tugboat 
for the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well 
as communication and rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload 
bay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with 
the robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. 
The mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big. Zarya, 
while completely weightless in space, has 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, 
it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's 
commander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three 
space flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station 
pieces together. When mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity 
will form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide 
out to the tips of the solar arrays. Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking 
astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between 
the units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future 
visitors. The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, 
and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space 
walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction 
goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making 
preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel 
and docking system. Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic 
station for the first time, installing portable fans and lights. Friday 
they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next 
major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia. The 
other astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow 
of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of 
the Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new outpost, the 
crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 
15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days. Gretchen McClain, 
NASA's director in Washington for the international space station, 
said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small 
for individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, the annual 
cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's 
96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs for construction, she added, were 
$24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, 
for a total of $34.4 billion. Most experts outside the agency consider 
this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars 
spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle 
flights, which run about $800 million apiece.
