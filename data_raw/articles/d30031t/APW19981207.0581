Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of 
the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story 
tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It was the first time that the Russian-built 
Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever 
touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. 
``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the 
moment the two pieces came together. ``Congratulations to the crew 
of the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.'' 
The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy 
Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle 
robot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said. Then came the hard 
part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station 
pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the 
other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her 
crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, 
rather than direct line of sight. This was the first time such a ``blind'' 
docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged 
Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly 
above Unity. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. 
Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, 
and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for 
the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. 
The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. It took several 
tries, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together. 
The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission 
Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked 
the crew to release its hold on the docked Zarya. That did the trick. 
The union _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime 
_ set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach 
electrical connectors and cables between the two components. Mission 
Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned 
and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything 
occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from 
a piece of space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their 
final approach to Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of 
a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control 
ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three 
miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total 
of five miles from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have 
been ``probably a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control 
said. The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture 
of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot 
arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 
44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched 
from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity 
and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control 
module can be launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, 
Cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed 
as Russian flight controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully 
deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that 
system won't be needed before next summer, officials said. The only 
other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement 
part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, 
will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. 
It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be 
connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking 
astronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks 
are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical 
connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other 
tools for future crews. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour 
once all of the work is completed. NASA estimates 43 more launches 
and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble 
the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station 
will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, 
and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
