For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. 
``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana. ``Amen,'' replied 
a launch controller. Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat. 
But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would 
behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, 
forcing a delay. NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch 
Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which 
was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. The shuttle contains 
the second station component. The master alarm blared and red lights 
flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday. By 
the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic 
pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed 
the cutoff by a second or two. ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill 
Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander. 
``But we do things right. We do things by the book, and we're not 
going to cut any corners even if it means just shaving a second or 
two.'' The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw 
up their hands. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch 
apart: ``We were that close.'' The problem was confined to one of 
Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure dropped just 
long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive 
switch, then returned to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining 
the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were 
confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight is already a year 
late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in 
building the international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA 
about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour 
is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts 
will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station 
piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook up 
all the electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders, 
and attach handrails and tools for future crews. Until the alarm sounded, 
it looked as though the weather would be the only problem. Rain and 
clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours before liftoff, but drifted 
away with minutes to spare. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
and other dignitaries from around the world had gathered in the drizzle 
to see Endeavour and its crew off. ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating 
on a venture to the future,'' said Albright, who was expected back 
for Friday's attempt. ``This is a good investment.''
