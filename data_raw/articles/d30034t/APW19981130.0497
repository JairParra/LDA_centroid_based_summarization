Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to 
four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands 
of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader 
said. A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school. 
Troops and riot police patrolled the streets. There were no immediate 
reports of serious injuries or arrests as fighting between Muslims 
and Christians continued after dark, said a military officer who spoke 
by telephone on condition of anonymity. The violence in the Christian-dominated 
city of Kupang was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 
22 churches by Muslim mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 
14 people were killed. Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority 
not to retaliate with more violence. Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's 
largest Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused 
provocateurs of whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast 
Asian nation is trying to head toward democracy. ``I hope Muslims 
... are not deceived by such provocations,'' said Wahid, who has been 
pushing for religious unity. West Timor shares the same island as 
troubled East Timor, a former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman 
Catholicism and invaded by Indonesia in 1975. Christians, mostly Protestants, 
dominate Kupang, about 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of 
the Indonesian capital. However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives 
there. The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged 
a peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church attacks. 
Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the capital 
of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for calm. Organizers 
of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day of mourning.'' 
However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after rival 
gangs pelted each other with rocks. Indonesia is the world's most 
populous Islamic nation. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million 
people are Muslims, with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist 
or other faiths. Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined 
in the national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia 
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. The upsurge 
in religious violence follows months of riots and protests in many 
parts of Indonesia. Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian 
nation have intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis 
in decades. There is also political turmoil as students protesters 
demand greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former 
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in 
May. Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition 
United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More 
than 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta Sunday 
at the opening of a four-day convention. Religious strife erupted 
recently in the eastern part of the main island of Java, where more 
than 150 people, many of them Islamic clerics, have been murdered, 
apparently by rival Muslim groups. Many of the dead were accused of 
practicing black magic.
