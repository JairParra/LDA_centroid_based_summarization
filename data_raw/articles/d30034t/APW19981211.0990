Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said 
Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village 
in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese 
and wounding 22 others. The report could not be independently confirmed, 
and Indonesian officials were not immediately available for comment. 
The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former 
Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence 
Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old 
farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during 
the attack, the statement, which cited resistance sources in East 
Timor's capital, Dili. The statement, released in the Portuguese capital 
of Lisbon, also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing. 
The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed. Roque 
Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese 
Resistance, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated 
the report with six sources inside East Timor and said he had ``no 
reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement. The United Nations, 
which is brokering talks between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's 
political future, still regards Portugal as the administering power 
in East Timor. The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers 
(1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
