In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders 
Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East 
Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975. 
``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible 
without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese 
people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end 
summit. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement 
marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East 
Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under 
Indonesian rule. Indonesia has resisted such calls for a referendum 
and maintains thousands of troops to keep order in the half-island 
territory. The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a 
``real and substantial reduction'' in troop levels and called for 
the establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor. The 
leaders repeated a demand that Indonesia release jailed Timorese rebel 
leader Xanana Gusmao, and all political prisoners. Indonesia invaded 
East Timor in 1975 as Portugal prepared to grant independence, and 
annexed it the following year. The United Nations does not recognize 
Indonesian rule.
