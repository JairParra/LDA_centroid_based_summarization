Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more 
than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending 
U.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory. Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle 
the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official 
Antara news agency reported. Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia 
in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of 
East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops. 
East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, 
has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near 
the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast 
of Dili, East Timor capital. The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said 
that so far, only 11 bodies had been identified. Alatas said the claims 
of a massacre were not true. ``The Portuguese delegation, without 
checking the truth of the information, decided to temporarily suspend 
the ongoing dialogue,'' Antara quoted Alatas as saying. The New York-based 
group Human Rights Watch said some deaths had occurred in fights between 
rebels and Indonesian forces. However, it could not confirm claims 
that dozens of people had been killed. Alatas said it was the third 
time that Portugal had unilaterally suspended talks over East Timor 
since 1986. Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia was skeptical about 
Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported. In response, Portugal's Foreign 
Ministry accused Indonesia of breaking promises to reduce its military 
presence in East Timor and called for a permanent U.N. mission in 
the disputed territory. ``Unfortunately, Indonesia has increased its 
deployment and the brutality of its military actions in East Timor,'' 
said ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar. Meanwhile, about 500 students 
ended their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's 
governor in Dili Tuesday after receiving promises that the reported 
killings would be investigated. In a dialogue with the students' representatives, 
Governor Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman 
agreed to set up a team to make a thorough investigation. The group 
earlier had spent one night occupying the provincial Parliament and 
vowed to stay at the governor's office. The students also demanded 
a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor. Meanwhile, 
an unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, was reported to have 
shot and wounded Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in Baucau, 100 kilometers 
(62 miles) east of Dili. Izildo, 30, who was shot Sunday, was being 
treated at a military hospital in Dili. Indonesia invaded East Timor 
in 1975 and annexed it the following year. The United Nations, however, 
does not recognize Indonesia's claim. Before being suspended, the 
talks centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy 
in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty 
there.
