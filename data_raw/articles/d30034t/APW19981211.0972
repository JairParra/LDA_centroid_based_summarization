Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said 
Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village 
in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese 
and wounding 22 others. The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco 
in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement 
issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East 
Timor. Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and 
killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement 
claimed. Jose Pau Lelo, 38, Rosito Borges, 35, and Leao Soares, 50, 
were in a coma due to injuries they sustained in the attack, according 
to the statement which cited resistance sources in East Timor's capital 
Dili. The statement, released in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, also 
said 19 men were wounded, eight seriously, and 26 others were missing. 
The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed. There 
was no independent confirmation of the attack, and Indonesian officials 
were was not immediately available for comment. Indonesia invaded 
East Timor in Dec. 1975, following Portugal's colonial rule, and annexed 
it a month later. Indonesian troops have since then been fighting 
a small band of pro-independence guerillas. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon 
spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, said he 
also had corroborated the report with six sources inside East Timor 
and said he had ``no reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement. 
The United Nations, which is brokering talks between Lisbon and Jakarta 
over the territory's political future, still regards Portugal as the 
administering power in East Timor. The half-island territory lies 
some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
