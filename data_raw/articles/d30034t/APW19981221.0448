JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an Indonesian 
army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto the runway 
tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers. Sent to make peace 
in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed Marker's recent hasty 
departure from the troubled territory signaled how easily tensions 
there can boil over. Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote 
a U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, 
said Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying 
a newfound taste for compromise. In an interview with The Associated 
Press, Marker admitted that a peaceful solution remains distant. But 
in a big step forward, he said, many separatist activists were no 
longer pressing for an immediate vote on independence. ``They don't 
want independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was interviewed in 
a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor. In other progress, 
Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to open ``interest'' sections 
in each other's capitals next month. Formal diplomatic relations, 
however, will not be resumed. Also in January, the two countries are 
scheduled to embark on a new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in 
New York. Turmoil has plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troops 
invaded in 1975, unleashing a separatist rebel war and the resentment 
of a population pummeled by human rights abuses. Talks were revived 
earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, 
but differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit 
all parties. Separatists want it to be transitional, while Indonesia 
is offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange 
for international recognition of its sovereignty. Jakarta wants to 
handle foreign, defense and financial affairs. Fears are widespread 
that more unrest in East Timor could derail the negotiations. On Monday, 
Marker voiced his concern in a meeting with East Timor's jailed rebel 
chief, Xanana Gusmao. ``I said there was a lot of tension in East 
Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to 
reduce it,'' said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United 
Nations. Tempers flared but there was no violence during protests 
timed for Marker's weekend trip to Dili, the seaside capital of the 
half-island territory of 800,000 people. On Sunday, separatist protesters 
tore down a fence at the commercial airport and pushed past soldiers 
with automatic rifles as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as 
he left. During a visit last year, Indonesian soldiers killed two 
pro-independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker was staying. 
Activists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troops into 
East Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number. Marker said Jakarta 
had advised him of troop rotations and that U.N. staff were monitoring 
the situation. Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President 
B.J. Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare 
for another batch of meetings in the New Year. ``If you ask me... 
`Do you have a solution?' then the answer is, `I don't,''' he said. 
``But I think there are ways of getting there and the first thing 
is to have peace and quiet.''
