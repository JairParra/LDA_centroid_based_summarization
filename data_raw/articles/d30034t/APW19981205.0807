Protesters on Sunday urged Australian military leaders to identify 
Indonesian army officers trained here to allow closer monitoring of 
human rights abuses in East Timor. The Australian military holds joint 
training exercises with Indonesian troops, including the elite commando 
units accused ot atrocities in East Timor. In Queensland, about 100 
activists gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south 
of Brisbane, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Indonesian invasion 
of East Timor. ``It is a peaceful protest against Australia training 
Indonesian soldiers,'' spokesman Jason McLeod said. The protesters 
wanted Australia to cut all military ties with Indonesia despite Defence 
Minister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercises would 
resume, he said. ``The Australian government has repeatedly refused 
to allow the Indonesians trained here to be identified,'' McLeod said. 
``But we are demanding they be named along with their unit and battalion 
number because this will allow closer monitoring of human rights issues,'' 
he said. McLeod said 40,000 East Timorese were killed by Japanese 
soldiers for protecting Australian commandos during World War II. 
``When they finally left the country the Australians distributed leaflets 
saying they would never forget the people of East Timor,'' he said. 
The protesters wanted to remind Australia's current soldiers of that 
pledge. After Portugal abandoned its former colony in East Timor in 
1975, Indonesia invaded it and annexed it the following year. The 
United Nations refuses to recognize the annexation as legitimate; 
Australia is one of the few nations that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty 
over East Timor.
