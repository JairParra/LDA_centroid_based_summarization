Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 
11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest 
rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten 
of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their 
key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant 
plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 
percent. The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. 
It is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is 
launched. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying 
the groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected 
rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before 
the cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels had become a 
contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany 
and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, 
stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro. The head of 
the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro 
nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggested governments should 
reform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to 
cut rates. The remarks in Brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave 
no hint that a rate drop was imminent, but made clear his resistance 
to political pressure was as strong as ever. So strong, in fact, that 
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would 
delay the decision. ``What had been feared was that, in order to prove 
its independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would 
wait longer, which would have been nonsensical,'' Zalm said. Hans 
Tietmeyer, who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled, 
hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency, 
dampened by global economic crises and Europe's worsening outlook. 
``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current 
pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,'' Tietmeyer 
said. The cuts seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main 
index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's was up 1.8 percent. The 
cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, 
which is not among the nations launching the euro. ``The reaction 
is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy.' 
But confidence has taken quite a hit across Europe recently, and I 
think further action from the ECB will be needed next year, maybe 
down to 2.5 percent,'' James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist 
with Nomura. An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth 
Van de Craen, said the cuts were timely. ``We are clearly headed for 
a slowdown,'' she said. Until recently, Europe's economies had held 
out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic 
crises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg 
painted the bleakest picture yet of Europe's economies, warning growth 
will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectations 
of 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making it cheaper to borrow 
money, rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, making 
it less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands 
the economy. The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium, 
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Spain and Portugal.
