Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities 
market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, 
French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would 
join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the 
precursor of a pan-European market. The Bourse in Paris also announced 
that it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European 
exchanges to discuss ``the steps and conditions needed to create a 
unifying and competitive pan-European equity market.'' The two announcements 
show how the introduction of the currency, the euro, is reshaping 
Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans to think in Continental 
rather than national terms in finance and business. And it suggested 
that exchange authorities in Paris, ruffled by the announcement in 
July of a ``strategic alliance'' between the London Stock Exchange 
and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not only abandoned an effort 
to set up a rival market but were also seeking to gain the initiative 
by organizing the Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, 
about the timing and technicalities of the French entry into the alliance. 
Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, ``Paris is joining this 
alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company.'' 
However, officials in London and Frankfurt _ who welcomed the idea 
in principle _ declined to say whether the timing and the arrangements 
were as far advanced as Strauss-Kahn implied. ``I'm afraid I can't 
confirm anything like that,'' a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange 
said. ``The appearances are well ahead of the reality at this point,'' 
said an American banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Not only that, the notion of a Europe-wide exchange raises technical 
questions about the compatibility not just of trading systems but 
also of the regulations governing stock market operations in the countries 
that will use the euro beginning in January. That has led some analysts 
to forecast that a pan-European exchange could not be up and running 
before 2000. ``There are an awful lot of issues to be resolved,'' 
the American banker said. The euro is to be introduced for electronic 
trading of equities, bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers. 
Notes and coins _ the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will 
carry _ will be introduced only in 2002. Initially, the currency will 
group 11 European nations in a euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, 
Sweden and Greece on the outside. With its concentration of banking 
and trading, however, London is expected to continue as the main market 
center. The prospect has heightened pressure for consolidation among 
exchanges. Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and 
Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London-Frankfurt 
alliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity 
for trading in British and German blue-chip issues. The London exchange 
estimates that a pan-European stock exchange would group together 
companies with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compared 
with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, 
the third largest of the European exchanges and the last major holdout 
toward a pan-European market, said that it had also invited officials 
from exchanges in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. 
A spokeswoman said officials from the London Stock Exchange would 
be at the meeting. Also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange 
and the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they 
were considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest 
energy futures markets. Discussions began in July, and the exchanges 
have formed a working group to study a merger. They already cooperate 
in the development of a system intended to coordinate after-hours 
electronic trading.
