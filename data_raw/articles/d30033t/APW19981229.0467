Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European 
Union members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should 
take part, according to a poll published Tuesday. The survey by the 
Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed 
favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remaining 
10 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast 
by TV2 channel. Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of 
the monetary union for the time being. After voters in 1992 rejected 
the Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out 
clauses. The treaty then was approved. Danish voters traditionally 
have been lukewarm supporters of the EU. Although many politicians 
support the unified currency, they have been wary about bringing the 
issue to voters again. A poll published last October showed 46 percent 
of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed. 
It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the 
new currency. The government has said it has no plans to hold a referendum 
before the year 2001.
