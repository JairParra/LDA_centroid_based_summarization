The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as 
their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the 
European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued 
the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. 
Annual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in 
November 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation 
EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to 
1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Germany, 
France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, 
Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro as a common 
currency at midnight on New Year's Eve. The latest figures may hint 
at trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increases over 
the year in Portugal and Ireland. With the European Central Bank setting 
a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the 
low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany 
may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth. There 
was good news for Greece which was kept out of the euro-zone for failing 
to meet economic conditions for joining, including low inflation. 
It's rate was 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before. 
Greece hops to join the euro-zone in 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain 
decided to stay out of the euro for political reasons. Eurostat gave 
the following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: 
Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 
0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 
1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 
(1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 
2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5).
