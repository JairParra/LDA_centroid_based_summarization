Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 
26, was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris. 
When his phone went dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into 
the underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent, the London-based 
French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. 
``I definitely describe myself as a European,'' he said in the fluent 
English he perfected working at an Australian bank. ``I may get sentimental 
when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical things, 
I see myself as a citizen of Europe. I like the lifestyle in France, 
but I don't make my living there.'' The year 1999 is the official 
start-up date of the euro, the common European currency that will 
unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, a different 
kind of integration has already taken root. Routiers, who was spending 
a day in Paris to meet with his bank's French clients, is at the vanguard 
of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves 
for a shock in the new year. Mobile, fluent in several languages and 
aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of 
borderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency 
is supposed to advance. They do not share their parents' memories 
of World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. ``People 
worry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because 
it suggests that at the end of the day, we have one government,'' 
said Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in London. ``Countries 
are afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it as a bad 
thing. If a government is good, stable and efficient, who cares if 
it is based in Berlin or Athens?'' Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business 
in the United States and Britain, could serve as a model for the new 
Europeans. He works for a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English 
and French, and in the past year has traveled, among other places, 
to Belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds 
of thousands of other Europeans, he chose London _ and its busy financial 
markets _ as the best place to work. He said he does not feel as if 
he lives in England. He lives in London, the clubhouse of financial 
Europe. And membership has its privileges. Papadopoulos lives in the 
fashionable Knightsbridge area, drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels, 
and works out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. ``I went 
to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners' 
I met were from the Middle East,'' he says. ``Now friends and co-workers 
are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel 
it everywhere. The streets are jammed with foreigners. Not tourists 
_ people who live and work here.'' Baby-boomers in Europe often describe 
themselves as the 1968 generation, weaned on the protest and social 
turmoil that convulsed European societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic 
but equally significant was a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement 
within what were then the six countries of the Common Market. A Frenchman 
could work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a 
permit. Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations, 
particularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries 
to the more prosperous north. Actually, as huge industries like steel 
shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunities for working-class 
Europeans. There are 15 countries within what is now the European 
Union, but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to 
other countries, according to estimates prepared by Eurostat. Those 
who do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids 
or garbage collectors. There are still legal barriers preventing most 
doctors, lawyers and academics from finding work in other countries. 
So far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by white-collar 
business executives who eagerly followed career opportunities across 
national borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years 
ago that kind of mobility was the preserve of a far smaller elite, 
the top executives of major companies or multinational corporations. 
Technology, from high-speed trains to the ever-evolving apparatus 
of business _ lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines _ has made 
European mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs 
and even students. Cable television, which allows Germans to watch 
Italian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs, has spread 
the Zeitgeist to the masses. This year Superga, an Italian brand of 
sports clothes and shoes, opened a major advertising campaign with 
a series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily 
cavorting with European leaders _ a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle 
up the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, 
a young man playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane 
of the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. ``This kind of ad would 
not have been possible five or 10 years ago,'' said Aldo Cernuto, 
executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche 
Lowe, an international advertising agency. ``Now European unification 
is on the TV all the time; it has seeped into people's unconscious. 
Even people who do not care about politics recognize the faces of 
a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did.'' 
According to the European Union, Britain has twice as many EU citizens 
as France, but it is not the country with the highest concentration 
of residents from other European countries. According to estimates 
based on surveys prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third of the residents 
of tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and a high standard 
of living, are from other European countries. Belgium, which has the 
European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5.4 percent. 
Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that 
has held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the nerve 
center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans 
_ bankers and business executives drawn by London's financial district, 
a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. 
Perhaps just as surprisingly, London also serves as an example of 
another less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism _ the breakdown 
of certain social barriers. Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved 
to the sons and daughters of Europe's elite. Now the European Union 
has a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that 
this year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent 
of the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries 
within the Union for up to a year, free. In the last 20 years, business 
schools in Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA programs 
that teach an American approach to business. This too has allowed 
a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business. ``Juergen 
Schrempp, the head of Daimler, started as a car mechanic,'' noted 
Stephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins 
University School for International Studies in Washington. ``That 
would have been unthinkable in Germany 20 years ago.'' Social mobility, 
moreover, is fueled by movement. When people transfer to another country, 
they find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trappings 
of home. ``I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed 
in Paris,'' Routier explained. ``France is still very hierarchical. 
Bosses want to know where you went to school, what your father does. 
In London, none of that matters as long as you make money.'' Many 
Britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions. 
For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines 
in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago, 
and never looked back. He has lived all over Europe, and is fluent 
in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, 
a car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. Smith 
said he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home. ``I 
didn't go to public schools or Oxbridge,'' he explained. ``I'm not 
saying its impossible, but it would have been much more difficult 
in England.'' Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves 
bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth 
and breeding do not matter as much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work 
in London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent. Mrs. 
Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and 
Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both 
were attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan 
in 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived 
and traveled all over the world. She works on the Eastern European 
desk of a British bank; he works for a major international consulting 
firm. Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe said 
the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible 
for her to find as good a job. ``I went to job interviews at Italian 
banks and they only asked me about my husband's job,'' she said with 
a grimace. ``And they made it clear that they were afraid I would 
get pregnant and ask for maternity leave.'' Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, 
a professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school 
in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking 
_ choosing the best deal for herself. As he put it, ``If they cannot 
find what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere.'' 
Twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the same 
thing. A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he lives and teaches 
in France and does consulting work all over Europe, from Sweden to 
the Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone is in three languages 
_ French, Flemish and English. His students, a generation behind him, 
see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. These Europeans form 
an advance guard that is still relatively small in numbers, but experts 
say they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies. ``In 
Germany, for example, it is the business people who are pushing ahead 
with change and pulling politicians along behind them kicking and 
screaming,'' Szabo said. ``They are looking at a larger market and 
feel the competitive pressures of globalization. Politicians are responding 
to a domestic constituency. They are answering to an international 
one.''
