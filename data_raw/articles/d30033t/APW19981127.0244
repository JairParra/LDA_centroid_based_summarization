In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank 
President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing 
in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on 
Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation 
in the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue 
to boost the economy. He pointed also to a gradual improvement in 
labor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate 
cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. 
Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 
22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the 
outlook for inflation and the EU economy. The bank, which will set 
monetary policy for the currency bloc, has been under pressure from 
politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create 
jobs. While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1 
percent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in the 11 nations remains 
stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.
