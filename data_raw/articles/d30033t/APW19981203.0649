In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the 
euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the 
rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Ten 
of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate 
to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated 
move was a key step in preparing for economic union. Setting a common 
interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left 
governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help 
boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the 
euro zone. European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint 
of the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead 
suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create 
jobs. In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central 
bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent. Rates 
before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency zone, from 
3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria. The European Central 
Bank said in a statement from its Frankfurt headquarters that the 
move was decided during a meeting Tuesday of its the policy-making 
governing council. The governing council comprises the 11 heads of 
national central banks plus a six-member directorate, including the 
bank president Duisenberg. ``The joint reduction in interest rates 
has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates 
with which the (bank) will start ... monetary union,'' the statement 
said, adding the 3-percent rate would be maintained ``for the foreseeable 
future.'' In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the 
move reflected the worsening outlook for European economies, and wasn't 
a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. 
``It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political pressure,'' 
Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut. ``The coordinated rate 
cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction 
in financial market turbulence,'' he said. But Tietmeyer, head of 
the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does 
not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy. ``It's not a shift 
from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy,'' he said. Growth in Europe 
has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence 
on international financial markets. Duisenberg has said growth in 
the euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower 
than the 3 percent predicted earlier.
