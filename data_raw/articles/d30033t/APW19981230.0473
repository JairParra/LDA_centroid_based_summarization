Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in 
an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing 
half his term as earlier agreed. ``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me 
that question. The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, 
which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the 
job. Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European 
Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new 
single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1. France surprised its 
euro partners by proposing its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, 
at the last minute for the job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily. 
Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after 
four years of his eight year term although he has since said no such 
``gentleman's agreement'' exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, a newspaper 
that fervently has backed the euro, that the the introduction of the 
new currency is the most ``significant'' step so far toward European 
unification. However, he said that he would like to see further political 
integration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social policies.
