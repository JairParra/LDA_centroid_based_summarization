There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts 
or phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso 
wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning 
by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential 
palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared 
with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. 
But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, 
he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. So 
goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, 
a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace were closed, 
and the use of cellular phones and copiers was restricted. The price 
of a buffet offered employees for lunch was raised from dlrs 6 to 
dlrs 8.50. Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. 
On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation 
of just eight, half the usual number. The savings at the palace could 
come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator 
of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy 
battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the 
full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to 
include a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and 
bank transactions. The plan is part of a deal with the International 
Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The 
money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence 
in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial 
crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year. Brazil already 
has agreed to annual targets to sharply reduce its deficit through 
the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers published a joint statement 
from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't been reached 
yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less than impressed 
by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said the government 
was making a big deal of insignificant savings while it failed to 
cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 moat being built 
around Congress to keep protesters from easily entering the building. 
The Globo TV network also suggested there still was plenty of fat 
to cut, citing government expenses for running shoes, Persian carpets 
and gold cufflinks, intended as presents for visiting dignitaries. 
Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governors to control 
spending. But the governors, some facing runoff elections on Sunday, 
are promising pay raises and public works projects that could sink 
the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil 
service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would 
cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explained where the money would 
come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost 
certainly have to lay off workers _ the state payroll consumes 78 
percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial 
politicians, Cardoso reportedly wants to hold local governments to 
bimonthly limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be 
cut off if spending gets out of hand.
