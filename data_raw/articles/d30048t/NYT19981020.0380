The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of 
the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, 
reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion 
in August to $16.77 billion. That is the widest gap since the government 
recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992. It resulted 
from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this 
country buys from abroad. So far this year, the trade deficit is running 
roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected 
$170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. 
One senior administration official who deals with economic issues, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections 
suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a 
figure that he said ``will certainly cut into growth, and could well 
become a major political problem.'' Trade deficits carry with them 
both good and troubling signals about the economy. The current flood 
of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels 
in decades. And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and 
other goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets 
in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American 
exporters. But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem 
facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some 
large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to 
make ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze of economic activity 
that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers. 
And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers who can 
no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen 
who are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has 
been ruined by the banking crisis. Among the most surprising elements 
of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit 
was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst 
effects of the global troubles: China. Despite continued growth of 
the Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and 
imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately 
seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in 
Asia. That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, 
levels previously only seen in trade with Japan. The Chinese _ besieged 
by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient 
banking crisis _ have signaled to the United States in recent weeks 
that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets 
further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. That 
amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years 
has been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body 
as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and 
politically. Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the 
administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's 
China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is 
evaporating. The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American 
economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to 
lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration 
officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers 
as another warning sign, but not a crisis. ``While the United States 
remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace 
continue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce 
Secretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday. After China, 
the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August 
came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion 
has spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remained 
unchanged. But imports from Mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly 
automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment 
_ as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening 
currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest 
focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary 
Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. Normally, that 
would be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products 
in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be 
imperiled. The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete 
a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help 
it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through 
Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil 
reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and 
next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections 
in Brazil this weekend. But for all these potential problems, the 
rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because 
the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment 
here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and Senate 
around the country. The only exception has been in regions where the 
steel industry is strong. The major steel companies have charged in 
recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American 
market at prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department has 
begun an inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the 
deficit rose 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised 
figure of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption 
of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may 
have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM brought 
in parts from abroad. The deficit was the highest since the Commerce 
Department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. 
Exports, the department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about 
$74.8 billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion.
