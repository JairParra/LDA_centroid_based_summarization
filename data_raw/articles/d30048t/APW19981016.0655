Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit 
to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global 
financial crisis. Not since the early 1980s have so many countries 
been in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's 
developing economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, 
described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important 
issue facing the world at the moment. ``I don't know if we are coming 
to the end of the world economic order. It will be interesting to 
know,'' the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly 
after his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing 
the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that 
``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably 
also to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments 
and loans in the region. Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash 
out of Latin America with devastating effects on stock markets and 
currency reserves. The heads of state and government from Latin America, 
Spain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial 
turmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets 
also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America. 
The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular reforms 
of their public finances, including austerity packages which risk 
social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be 
signed Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern 
Portugal. Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final 
statement. The declaration ``calls on the international community, 
and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary 
measures to promote stability in international financial markets, 
which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said 
Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin 
America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory system for 
global financial transactions that would place controls on speculators, 
like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money. They also 
want reforms that allow international financial institutions to head 
off crises rather than react to them with rescue packages. ``International 
institutions must be active in tackling crises like the recent one 
... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime 
Gama said. ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be 
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in reference 
to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their economies. Brazil, 
the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping 
recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package 
from the International Monetary Fund. The presidents of the World 
Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected at the 
talks. The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates 
Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, but analysts expected 
the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns about the 
continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed 
in part from the structural weaknesses of Latin American economies. 
A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a government 
austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that could arise 
if tough reforms are introduced. Brazil is drafting an austerity package 
that will hit public spending, especially social security.
