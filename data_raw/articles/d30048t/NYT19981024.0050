The United States is preparing to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part 
of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, 
and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the 
financial turmoil circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign 
officials assembling the program. Details of the U.S. contribution, 
which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or 
loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. But several congressional 
leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration 
would have to act while Congress is in recess. This early warning 
from the administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted 
with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed 
$20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico. But administration 
officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that 
members of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic 
collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, 
and thus they expect few objections. The timing of an aid package 
for Brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated 
by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian 
government. The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may 
well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that 
is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating 
with the International Monetary Fund. The biggest role in the rescue 
program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, 
which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion 
_ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even 
more. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United 
States and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, 
have been reluctant to take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting 
that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. 
So far, U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid 
package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for 
a direct contribution to Brazil. ``Brazil is very important to the 
economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international 
community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can 
be helpful,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday. But 
in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Rubin 
declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with Brazil's 
problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the 
United States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity 
to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President 
Clinton advocated in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three 
weeks ago. At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should 
``provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial 
contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike. Direct U.S. aid 
to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year 
of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, 
the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own 
capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but 
to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that 
are major U.S. trading partners. That would be a change of strategy. 
So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international 
financial institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky 
move for President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though 
Congress objected to the $20 billion in U.S. funds committed to the 
bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately 
needed, and it has since been paid back, with interest. But Rubin 
noted on Friday that ``it's a very different environment now.'' Other 
administration officials say they believe that there would be few 
objections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout. 
``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared 
to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen 
in their own districts,'' a White House official said last week, ``and 
they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.'' By 
acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is hoping 
to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer 
panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of 
a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the 
next country forced to devalue its currency. Whether this calm marks 
the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires 
that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is 
a matter of considerable debate. But many experts cite the confluence 
of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the 
world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's 
long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion 
in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, 
Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing 
to return. Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly 
on markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there 
have been a number of significant, positive developments.'' But the 
former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market 
rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will 
take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has 
repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption 
of the last 50 years.'' In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous 
about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new 
round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market 
countries to borrow money on world markets. ``Brazil and Japan are 
the two obvious tinderboxes,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale 
School of Management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for 
international affairs during Clinton's first term. ``In Brazil, the 
issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be 
big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem. And in Japan the 
question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the 
money.'' But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese, 
Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in 
Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not 
lack of resources. In Brazil, though, the United States has a better 
chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, 
as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso 
and his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require 
tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt 
administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under Rubin's 
control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent 
congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995. But the reaction 
was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for 
international bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious 
ever since. He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense'' 
in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, 
but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country. U.S. officials 
said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse 
of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene 
there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid. In the 
bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris 
Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed 
the leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help. 
Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging 
markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian 
officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking 
about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators 
that it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the 
same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they 
do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get 
it. U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous, 
worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will 
be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil. 
``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' 
said an investment banker involved in the talks. ``But the fact is 
that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months 
the government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which 
is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a 
carefully controlled fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian 
government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, 
choking off credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country is slipping 
into recession. The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it 
is contingent on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to 
end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending. 
The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary 
Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's 
austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections 
but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that 
the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil. ``Brazil has 
to do a lot,'' Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip. 
``In return, I expect the international community will make a large 
contribution.''
