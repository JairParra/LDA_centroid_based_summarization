Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing 
touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of 
global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international 
financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market 
turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the 
difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.'' The 
declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations. The Group 
of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, 
France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved at 
Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. Brazilian 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and 
China, two of the world's largest economies, had become the ``dikes 
of resistance'' to global recession. Protecting their economies from 
the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries 
than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, 
he said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest 
in the world, and its economic collapse could take the rest of the 
continent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso 
is preparing austerity measures including spending cuts, tax hikes 
and lower interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for 
an International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 
billion. The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling dlrs 137 
billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 months ago and 
then spread from Asia to Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, 
aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on 
the United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank 
to support Brazil after it was hit by investor flight.
