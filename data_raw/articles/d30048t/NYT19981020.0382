Brazilian officials ended four days of meetings with representatives 
of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without living up to 
their public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce government 
deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the 
Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans 
for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years. With 
only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither 
he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how 
the government planned to achieve the savings. Important allies of 
Cardoso are lagging behind in three key states, and despite the government 
promises, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after 
the elections. Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared 
to focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit 
was going forward, without providing fodder for opponents in domestic 
elections. ``The discussions continue with the objective of reaching 
agreement soon on the detailed program,'' said a joint statement by 
the IMF and the Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because of Brazil's enormous 
deficits, the collapse of emerging markets has hit the nation particularly 
hard, draining foreign currency reserves and pushing the economy toward 
recession. Finance officials in Washington and around the world fear 
that a collapse of Brazil, because of its size and links to other 
economies, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. 
With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest 
economy and is the financial engine of Latin America. Throughout the 
day, government officials met with Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected 
to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso was to discuss 
with congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, 
officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax 
increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from 
two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, 
which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential 
discretionary spending. The fund was to have expired by 1999. Speaking 
in Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus 
of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. 
It had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting 
in Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary 
account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for IMF aid. 
The primary account covers government expenses, without interest payments 
on debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and 
the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and 
that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week. 
``I call this the `We have a pope' scenario,'' Brown said. ``You're 
just going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke 
rising,'' he said, ``and not figure out who the pope is until after 
the elections.''
