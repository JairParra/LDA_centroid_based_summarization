Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories 
fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end 
bonus. So they're considering paying with products instead of cash. 
Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as 
hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus 
that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of 
Brazil's largest federation of trade unions. ``The idea is completely 
unacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the 
federation, which represents more than 2,000 unions and 19 million 
workers. ``We will recommend our unions reject such a preposterous 
proposal.'' But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates 
and declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said 
Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small 
Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly 
800,000 workers. ``Access to credit is almost impossible,'' Curi said. 
``If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency 
credit line, the only option many of our associates will have will 
be to use products to pay the bonus.'' Factories that produce clothes, 
shoes, food, toys and household appliances were ``the most enthusiastic 
about the idea,'' Curi said. Curi predicted even harsher times for 
Brazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday. 
The measures, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget deficit 
_ equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product _ are expected 
to include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. ``There is a lot 
of talk of increasing taxes, which means less cash circulating in 
the market and more credit restrictions,'' Curi said. ``It is a shortsighted 
approach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small 
factories.'' Brazil has been a major casualty of the global economic 
crisis, buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow 
of capital. The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 
50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. In an effort 
to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem 
capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. For 
union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap ``is a clear 
sign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the 
recessive economic policies'' brought by the Real Plan, the economic 
stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso was finance 
minister. The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent 
to almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, 
which now stands at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade.
