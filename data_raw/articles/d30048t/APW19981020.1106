Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to 
agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's 
ninth-largest economy. A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian 
government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its 
budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product 
to zero by 2000. The statement was issued after weekend talks between 
IMF officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, 
executive secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the 
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the 
talks. Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to 
contribute to the rescue package. Brazil is the latest country to 
be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and 
then spread to Russia. Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign 
currency reserves since August when Russia defaulted on its debts 
and sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market countries. 
If instability continues in Brazil it could affect Argentina, its 
main trading partner, and other Latin American economies. Despite 
the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as 
president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had 
agreed on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors 
continued to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil. Cardoso is 
preparing an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor 
confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors 
want Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he is expected to 
wait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, 
whose support he needs for his budget cuts. The joint statement said 
the Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed at preparing the ground for 
prompt support by the international community, including the IMF, 
for the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian 
authorities, which will include new policy initiatives.'' The statement 
reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 
2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 
2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government 
target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector 
debt to GDP by the year 2000.'' The two sides are to continue their 
talks ``with the objective of reaching early agreement,'' the statement 
said.
