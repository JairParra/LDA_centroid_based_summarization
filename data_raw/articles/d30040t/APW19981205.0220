The first Palestinian commercial flight landed at Amman's Marka Airport 
on Saturday, inaugurating an air route between Jordan and the autonomous 
Gaza Strip. The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, 
mostly Palestinian businessmen and students. The plane will return 
later in the day. Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport 
in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River 
accord which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians 
in return for security guarantees. Jasser Ziyyad, director-general 
of the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with 
the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between 
them _ two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan. Meanwhile, 
Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation officials 
as saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian 
fleet of three short-haul aircraft. It said the addition was necessary 
to transport an estimated 3,600 Palestinian Muslims who wish to travel 
to Saudi Arabia in early March to perform the annual pilgrimage to 
holy shrines in that country.
