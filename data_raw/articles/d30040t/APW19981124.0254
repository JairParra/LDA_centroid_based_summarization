Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday 
inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the 
world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism. An Egypt 
Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern 
Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt). But the emotional highlight was 
the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. 
After landing, the pilot and co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high 
above their heads as they descended the stairway. A chant of ``Allahu 
Akbar,'' or God is Great, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians 
who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations. 
``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later 
told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly decorated with 
deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics. Throughout the morning, 
Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes 
from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian 
Airlines flights. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the 
Palestinian state,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V 
sign. However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the 
authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor arriving 
passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers 
them a danger to Israeli security. Disputes between Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening 
for more than two years. In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian 
security agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and 
collected the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet 
ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags. Throughout the morning, 
there were spontaneous celebrations. As a police marching band played 
bagpipes, airport workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each 
other by their hands and danced in a circle. Some kissed and embraced 
their neighbors, others wiped away tears and several officers waved 
their rifles in the air. In one corner of the airfield, about 300 
people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to 
the beat of drums. The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost 
to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian 
flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, 
often with difficulties and delays. The airfield will also make it 
easier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans 
are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket. Until now, 
Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel 
and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv. The 
other option was to travel by land to Jordan and catch flights there. 
Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross 
Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to become 
easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens next 
month. Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian 
airport, citing security reasons. However, Israeli Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future. The 
opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's U.S.-sponsored 
Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel also 
withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released 250 
Palestinian prisoners. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza 
and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations 
on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing. Gaza International, 
with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in an Oriental style with 
graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco. The airport 
has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long 
runway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control 
tower wall. Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one 
Boeing 727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia 
next week. In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely 
on some improvisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls 
for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod. 
Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable control 
panel installed in a van. Despite its temporary shortcomings, many 
Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence. 
For those living in the small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed 
by the Mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, 
it may help ease the feeling of being trapped. ``Now we will be able 
to travel without the Israeli procedures that we usually must go through,'' 
said Khaled Salmeh, who studies economics at Gaza City University 
and plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.
