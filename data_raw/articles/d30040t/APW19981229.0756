Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian-run Gaza airport 
over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move 
that could further undermine the already fragile peace process. Palestinian 
airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check 
the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday 
afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according 
to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni. ``The Transportation 
Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, 
we won't allow the airport operate,'' he told The Associated Press. 
Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter sent Monday to chairman 
of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen. Fayez Zeidan. 
Zeidan was not immediately available for comment. Israel retains security 
control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport. The airport's 
opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians 
as a milestone toward independence and statehood. Since then, Israel 
has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence, 
and has frozen the accords. The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel 
of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel 
activities.
