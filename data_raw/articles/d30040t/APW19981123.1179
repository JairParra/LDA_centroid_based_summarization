The control tower is still without controls, the check-in counter 
has no computers and the runway can't function after dark for lack 
of flood lights. Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International 
Airport is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and 
a lot of patriotic pride. ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, 
a feeling that we are open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian 
watching while workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in 
the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday morning when a 
plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials becomes the first arrival. 
At half-hour intervals, six more planes are to come in from places 
such as Morocco and Spain. The European Union, which donated dlrs 
38 million for equipment and training, is sending its Mideast envoy 
on a special plane. The airport opening had been held up for two years 
because of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over 
Israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo. In the end, Israel 
will have a say over who and what is coming into the Gaza, but the 
Israeli monitors will operate discretely, behind one-way mirrors, 
as they do now at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossings into autonomous 
Palestinian areas. The airport protocol was signed last week, as part 
of the Wye River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza, 
said periodic security closures, which bar Palestinians from entering 
Israel, would not effect the operation of the airport. He said Israel 
was inspecting certain gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnet 
equipment for safety but that it wouldn't hold-up the airport from 
opening. The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez 
Zeidan, was not available Monday for comment. For the time being, 
it will still be a bit of an adventure to fly out of Gaza International 
or to land there. Palestinian officials say the equipment for the 
control tower, the computers for the check-in counters and the flood 
lights are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman 
for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority, acknowledged delays in some 
of the equipment reaching Dahanieh but said he did not know the reasons. 
Degani, from the Israeli military government, said some equipment 
was being held up by customs. Portable control, 12th graf pvs
