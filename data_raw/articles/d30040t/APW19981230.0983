Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from 
the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tensions in a rare 
area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. A plane bound for Amman, 
Jordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand that Palestinian 
officials inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio 
reported. The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his 
luggage. Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover 
from Saudi Arabia to Cairo, it said. Israeli airport security officials 
were not available for comment. Abdel Razek Yehia, a Palestinian official 
who helped negotiate the airport's opening, confirmed the delays. 
He said such differences did not undermine the peace process. ``Every 
day we have differences,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We are 
all doing all our best to continue the peace process.'' The airport's 
opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians 
as a milestone toward independence and statehood. Israel retains security 
control over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport, and Palestinian 
security officials consult with their Israeli counterparts. Earlier 
this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian 
airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check 
the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most 
of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials 
said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were 
aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli 
security checks. Since Wye, Israel has accused the Palestinians of 
failing to contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. 
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement 
to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
