Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the young Palestinian Authority 
prepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: its very 
own airport. As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and 
Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday 
and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would 
open Sunday. The airport has been nearly completed for months but 
Thursday officials there added a few extra touches of yellow paint 
and fresh flowers. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals 
at the airport. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may 
travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted 
the first international flight may be reserved for U.S. President 
Bill Clinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December. Egypt's Middle 
East News Agency said the first plane to land would be carrying Egypt's 
health minister and several doctors bearing medical supplies as gifts. 
Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, has forbidden 
its own citizens from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel 
2 TV said. And all flights, which must be approved by Israel in advance, 
would not be allowed to fly over their airspace. After touring the 
airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work needed to be done 
before the airport was ready for Clinton. ``It may be a landing site 
for President Clinton, but we're not confirming,'' said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``When you fly Air Force One, 
you're flying several planes and a lot of equipment,'' he said. The 
airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will 
have out of the Gaza Strip.
