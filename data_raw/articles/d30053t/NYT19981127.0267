President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian 
leaders, the White House said Friday. He is to speak at what the Palestinians 
are describing as a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel 
clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation 
of the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led to 
the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. 
As part of that settlement, reached at Wye, Md., Clinton agreed to 
travel to territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak 
at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the de facto parliament. 
According to a schedule released Friday by the White House, Clinton 
will visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day trip that 
will begin on Dec. 12. He is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before 
returning to Washington on Dec. 15. Clinton administration officials 
said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly 
to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, 
given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian 
soil with the trappings of a state visit. Officials said the White 
House was fearful of upsetting Israeli leaders who are worried that 
the president's planned visit to Gaza appears to be a step toward 
American recognition of a Palestinian state. The White House said 
the president would ``speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people 
about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue 
to support the Middle East peace process.'' The meeting in Gaza on 
Dec. 14 is bound to be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians 
have charged that the Wye agreement allows the Israeli government 
to backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace 
settlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already 
revoked clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction. 
In January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the anti-Israel 
provisions that he said had been annulled. But the letter did not 
satisfy the Israelis. And during the talks in Maryland last month, 
Arafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to ``reaffirm'' 
the decision to revoke the clauses. In order to guarantee passage 
of a motion to annul the provisions, Arafat is being allowed under 
an agreement with the Israelis and the United States to pack the council 
meeting in Gaza with his loyalists, and to conduct the vote by a show 
of hands instead of a ballot. During a recent interview with Israeli 
television, Clinton brushed aside concerns that his visit to Gaza 
might be seen as a step toward U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state. 
``That is not what I'm doing in going there,'' he said. ``I have tried 
strictly to adhere to the position of the United States that we would 
not take a position on any final status issue.'' He said he was traveling 
to Gaza at the recommendation of, among others, Netanyahu. ``The prime 
minister wanted me to go there and wanted us all to make this pitch,'' 
he said, adding that he would ask the Palestinian National Council 
``to support the peace and to renounce the idea of animosity toward 
and opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead 
embrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation.''
