Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention 
center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian 
delegates next week. U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived 
in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect 
Clinton during his first visit to Palestinian areas. ``There is cooperation 
with the American security people. We have our own plan. The Americans 
have their own procedures as well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, 
Ghazi Jabali. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle 
the accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However, 
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel 
in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt. On Monday, 
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members 
of the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, 
at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa 
Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security as 
well as uniformed officers with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifles began 
patrolling in the vicinity. Streets around the center are to be closed 
days before the Clinton visit. Four armored personnel were parked 
at the corners of the convention center, with members of Arafat's 
elite bodyguard unit, known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles. 
APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near the 
Palestinian legislative council. Jabali said the APCs were part of 
a Palestinian security plan that has been presented to the Americans. 
U.S. security agents, in turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts 
sophisticated explosives detection equipment. ``The Palestinian police 
are ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' 
Jabali said, referring to Clinton's expected visit next Tuesday to 
the Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem 
In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the 
Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The hotel boasts 
stunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the slopes of the 
Judean Desert.
