Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for 
a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the 
two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements 
and street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, 
warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish 
a state. ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance 
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in 
the West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security 
accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift 
communities on West Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the 
land from being turned over to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, at a meeting 
of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak 
of street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops 
in the West Bank. ``The Palestinians have been asked to immediately 
stop the violence and incitement to violence,'' the Cabinet said in 
a statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation 
outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. 
Demonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber 
bullets and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli 
soldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. 
And three days before that, Israelis were horrified by television 
footage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten 
with chunks of concrete by a Palestinian mob. Israel says Yasser Arafat's 
Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians 
deny that. The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter 
dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel last month 
freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release under the Wye accords, 
but most were criminals. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called 
security prisoners _ those being held for anti-Israel activity _ be 
released instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the 
scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian 
parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit. At 
the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to 
reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that 
call for Israel's destruction. Israel has demanded that the Palestinians 
hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming 
the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their 
objections to that. ``They haven't the right to give us instructions,'' 
Arafat said Sunday as he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe. 
Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is to begin 
Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords 
and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance. But 
some commentators suggested the visit was proving a polarizing force 
instead. ``He is coming to promote the peace process... but his visit's 
only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' Yosef Lapid 
wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing 
concern is being voiced over Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, the 
first ever by a sitting U.S. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet 
meeting, a shouting match broke out over the issue, according to Israel 
radio. ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan 
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu. Netanyahu 
said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States has repeatedly 
said the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, 
but the Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty 
hopes. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the 
invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was ``warmly welcomed'' 
by the Palestinians.
