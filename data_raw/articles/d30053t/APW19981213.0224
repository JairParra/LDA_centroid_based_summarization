In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met 
Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to 
put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. After getting 
together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met 
at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later. The 
president was sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding 
in Washington. At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, 
Netanyahu said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to 
true peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of 
ignoring commitments in peace accords. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police 
were deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. At the hotel 
where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen were posted to guard the president 
and his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their 
daughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured 
a school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while 
Chelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a picture-taking 
session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel ``has 
not left'' the Wye River agreement. ``We will not give up'' on the 
land-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, ``it should 
be based on mutual reciprocity.'' About two hours before Air Force 
One landed Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approved 
a fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. The full House will 
vote on the impeachment articles next week. Israeli government spokesman 
Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would 
turn on the question of revoking the Palestinian Liberation Organization's 
founding charter. ``President Clinton played a very important role 
in the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going 
to be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness 
on the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' 
Fogel said. There was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone 
throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student 
was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. In his remarks 
at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said the peace 
process is in danger. ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking 
in Hebrew, ``The truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians 
again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their 
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo 
fulfillment of those commitments.'' Netanyahu, who is facing political 
turmoil in his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept 
``a phony peace on paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.'' Since 
Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security 
agreement has hit one snag after another. Israel froze implementation 
of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and 
inciting violent street protests. Clinton said the United States shares 
Israel's concerns about security. ``Peace is not simply an option 
among many but the only choice that can avert still more years of 
bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow,'' he said. ``That is why I'm here.'' 
He said ``both sides now must face the challenge of implementing Wye.'' 
Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The Israeli 
leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament prepares 
for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition began to 
weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 
agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be met 
by Palestinian security measures. Netanyahu has said there would be 
no further troop withdrawals until West Bank rioting and violence 
ends. Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement 
over procedures for revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling 
for Israel's destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners 
held in Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish 
state. On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza 
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit. 
Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National 
Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood. 
``It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state,'' Ziyad 
Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council, said in 
an interview Sunday.
