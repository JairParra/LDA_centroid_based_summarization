On a street newly littered with the debris of battle _ stones, spent 
tear gas canisters, charred remnants of half-burned tires _ a sodden 
Palestinian flag flaps in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house 
in mourning. Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, 
neighbors and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university 
student felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's 
rubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened 
to symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly 
among themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence. Among 
those in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three 
days of family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator 
for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, 
was a cousin of his. Erekat stayed for a time, sitting amid clan elders 
in Arab headdresses and teen-age nephews in American-style athletic 
shoes, then slipped away for a meeting in connection with President 
Clinton's visit beginning this weekend. ``It's been very difficult,'' 
he said later, asked about carrying on his negotiating duties at such 
a time. ``I have a great sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of 
such loss. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen 
my determination for peace.'' The scene at the Erekat home, in the 
Arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home 
a central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides 
of the divide, the political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability 
goes to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of 
world attention, it is easy to forget that there are fewer people 
living in Israel and the Palestinian lands combined than there are 
in New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here 
choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Everyone has 
a stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous 
patrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass 
a sidewalk cafe once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb. 
Palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers 
and brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints 
and gunsights of Israeli troops. On both sides, the youngest soak 
up fear and anger along with their ABCs. And elders' memories of half 
a century past still rise to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow 
of the Holocaust for Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession 
for the Palestinians. Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little 
changed since biblical times, terrible Old Testament themes _ lamentation 
and retribution, the smiting of enemies and the sharpening of swords 
_ spring to life once again in any day's headlines. Now comes Clinton, 
this most American of presidents, one who has made Middle East peacemaking 
a kind of personal crusade, in hopes of halting what has become one 
of the century's most protracted blood feuds. Clinton is no stranger 
to these particular hatreds. Three years ago, in another winter season, 
he came here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by 
a nationalist Jew who could not abide the terms of a Mideast agreement 
that called _ just as this latest accord does _ for Israel to cede 
West Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. On the 
occasion of this visit _ first intended to celebrate the Wye River 
accords signed seven weeks ago in Washington, now meant to salvage 
them _ all three of the principals are embattled. Clinton is under 
an impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted by furious Palestinian street 
protests and his own failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
coalition government is hanging by a thread. The days leading up to 
Clinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow to simultaneously 
tap into both sides' greatest fears. In the West Bank's worst spasm 
of violence in months, Israelis watched windows of Israeli-plated 
cars shatter from stones thrown by angry youths, saw TV footage of 
a cringing Israeli soldier _ now facing court martial _ being beaten 
bloody by a Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortations 
for a new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, for their part, listened 
in anger as Netanyahu announced the suspension of an upcoming Israeli 
troop pullback in the West Bank and tried vainly to halt Israeli bulldozers 
expanding Jewish settlements on land they claim as their own. Both 
sides _ to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay _ came 
to see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood 
aspirations, despite increasingly desperate American efforts to avoid 
casting it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which 
is already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting 
American president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism 
for all it is worth, greeting him with the strains of their once-banned 
national anthem. In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends 
and relatives of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and 
statehood. They talked about Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled 
his disbelief as he cradled his dying cousin in his arms. His 14-year-old 
brother Taher spoke haltingly of the big brother he had looked up 
to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he 
had stuck to his studies as diligently as Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, the 
peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic to his young 
cousin's death. ``It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed,'' he said. 
``At these difficult times, you pray for one thing, for both sides: 
no more of it.''
