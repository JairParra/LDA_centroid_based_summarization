Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat 
of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not 
agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. 
Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians 
were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood 
because they believed they had the Clinton administration ``in their 
back pocket.'' ``The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye 
River accord. They think they have the United States in their back 
pocket,'' said the Israeli leader. ``As long as that is the case, 
they will not change their behavior.'' Netanyahu said he did not believe 
the United States was siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply 
worded remarks sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill 
Clinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior to his 
Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated 
the summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political 
activists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing Jewish 
settlers to seize hilltops for expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of 
the Palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team 
that negotiated the Oslo accords, told reporters Sunday ``all means 
of resistance'' was justified in opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, 
who rejected claims of settlement expansion as ``bunk,'' was interviewed 
in the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government, 
which rallied behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. But officials 
said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous 
to the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to 
Gaza and the West Bank. ``We are not going to give up territory when 
there are violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that 
weren't achieved at Wye using violence,'' Netanyahu said. Israel has 
threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled 
for Dec. 18, three days after Clinton's departure. The United States 
has said it should go ahead as scheduled. Palestinians see the Clinton 
trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even 
though Clinton has specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's 
Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu 
made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed at the 
newly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides said would be 
viewed as a strong symbol of support for Palestinian demands for sovereignty. 
``We will be very disappointed if that is the case. We've said to 
the United States that we don't think that is necessary,'' Netanyahu 
said of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. He said traveling 
by motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. ``Unless 
somebody wants to put a thumb in our eye, I think there are better 
ways to travel,'' Netanyahu said. In the interview, Netanyahu stressed 
that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop 
threatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians 
maintain the Oslo accords expire. ``What must be is that Yasser Arafat 
retracts this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River 
accords and recommits himself to negotiating until we get white smoke, 
until we get a solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said. In a conciliatory 
speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought 
a negotiated settlement and did not mention May 4 as a deadline. He 
also said any Palestinian state would not make alliances with states 
hostile to Israel _ one of Netanyahu's key concerns. The Israeli leader 
is also demanding that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promised 
at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks 
that resulted in bloodshed, rather than freeing car thieves and petty 
criminals. Each side has a different interpretation of the understanding 
regarding the prisoners. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free 
those with ``blood on their hands.'' ``It's high time that Yasser 
Arafat admits this was agreed upon and that he's not going to make 
demands on Israel, including the incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up 
charge, '' he said. ``Israel never promised to release murders at 
Wye, and it won't release them.'' The issue has been the focal point 
for a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West 
Bank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian 
inmates. Israel is also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member 
Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-Israel 
clauses in the Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained 
that only 25 members out of hundreds who live abroad had been invited 
so far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton as telling him that the purpose of 
his visit was to ``personally make sure that they actually rescind 
this charter that calls for Israel's destruction.''
