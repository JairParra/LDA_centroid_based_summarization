Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West 
Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote 
to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also 
rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, 
an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank. The Palestinians 
have said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by 
a vote, when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton's 
presence. With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown 
with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering 
in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he 
helped negotiate. Under the accord, the annulment of the offending 
provisions by the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. 
Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task 
because that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure. 
However, Israeli officials said they would not drop their demand for 
a vote. ``They have to vote in the PNC,'' said Israeli government 
spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn over 
additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians because ``transfer 
of territory is irreversible.'' In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department 
spokesman James Foley was evasive on whether the United States expected 
a vote from the PNC. ``The procedures need to be clear enough that 
nullification has taken place,'' he said. A senior Palestinian official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States has not 
asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote. 
On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a smaller 
leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central Council, declared 
the charter clauses revoked. The 95 members present were asked whether 
they approved a letter in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter 
clauses calling for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 
81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained. Asked about 
the decision, Arafat would only say that ``it was a very important 
and constructive meeting.'' The Palestinian leader also said he hoped 
Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under 
the Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter was 
drawn up three decades ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians 
started their peace process in 1993. The Palestinians say they took 
all the required steps to revoke the pertinent clauses at a PNC session 
in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed 
the job. During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agreed in a 
compromise to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to 
Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord says delegates 
should ``reaffirm'' the Arafat letter to Clinton, but does not specifically 
refer to a vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided 
with the Palestinians on Friday. ``They did it once, they did it twice, 
they don't have to do it again,'' said Peres, who was prime minister 
during the PNC vote in 1996. Israel and the Palestinians have also 
accused each other of violating other elements of the Wye agreement. 
A key point of contention has been Israel's pledge to release 750 
Palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January. The Palestinians 
have said Israel broke a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli 
activities. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused the 
Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue. Palestinian 
negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States offered a compromise, 
a trilateral committee to go over the list of prisoners one by one 
and determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary 
Danny Naveh said Friday such a proposal was unacceptable. ``Israel 
has not been offered such a compromise and there will not be such 
a compromise,'' Naveh said. On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the 
Islamic militant Hamas movement marched through the West Bank town 
of Nablus to press for the release or prisoners. ``We want prisoners, 
not Clinton,'' the crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's 
third holiest site, the prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out 
sharply against the U.S.-brokered peace agreement. ``America supports 
a peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of 
the Palestinian lands,'' he said.
