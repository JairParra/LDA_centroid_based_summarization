Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators 
to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, 
said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots 
with a ``firm hand.'' He added that he would not go ahead with a West 
Bank troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement, 
unless Arafat met a list of demands. The West Bank has been swept 
by stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians 
marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone 
mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. 
The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit 
to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more 
unrest rather than calming the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, 
including Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring 
statehood status on the Palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs reading 
``Clinton go home'' were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway 
and on walls in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton 
visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, 
the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, 
in Gaza City. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during 
this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of 
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. 
Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians 
say only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday 
he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton 
declares the PNC session a success without it. ``It is Israel which 
determines issues connected with its future,'' Netanyahu said when 
asked by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown 
with Clinton over the issue. It is unlikely the U.S. president would 
side with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the 
main purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, 
had failed. Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer 
five percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint jurisdiction. 
Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what he 
claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord. 
He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless 
Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian 
state in May. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing 
excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces 
a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down 
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, 
meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord. On Thursday, 
98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's 
seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat 
letter concerning the PLO charter. The meeting is an interim step, 
ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. 
A simple majority of 63 members is required, and a vote was expected 
by Thursday evening. The council has not met for years and was revived 
specifically for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members 
of the Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee, 
among others.
