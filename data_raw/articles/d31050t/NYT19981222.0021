Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged 
China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's 
policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese 
courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to 
long jail sentences. Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights 
groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of 
the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties 
with China in hopes of democratic reform. The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, 
who was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received 
an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received 
12 years were charged with subversion. The State Department said it 
had received reports from sources it did not identify that a third 
leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 
years in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives 
of Qin in China denied the reports, however, and said that his trial 
continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders 
during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself 
on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences, 
even as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of 
engagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, 
a State Department spokesman, said the United States ``deeply deplores'' 
the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents. 
``These three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than 
efforts to form a new political party,'' he said. While condemning 
the prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful 
to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress 
in human rights in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in 
Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. ``There had been improvements 
in the human rights situation in China, modest improvements,'' Foley 
said. The severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment 
of democracy campaigners in China _ are ``steps backward in relationship 
to what had been an improved human rights performance,'' he said. 
Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison 
sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang delivered a 
pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic 
reforms were not a prelude to Western-style democracy. ``The Western 
mode of political systems must never be copied,'' he said, adding 
that those who challenged the Communist Party's supremacy would be 
crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's 
harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out 
to Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the president's 
visit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true intentions regarding 
human rights.'' ``They are pathetic, really pathetic,'' she said of 
the administration. ``The administration can say what it wants, but 
it must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. 
What the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in 
the world.'' Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights 
Group, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration 
to revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost entirely'' 
driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade. He said 
that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights 
situation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement 
to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the 
overall picture was bleak. ``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress 
China has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled 
out by a more repressive attitude.'' Human Rights Watch, the largest 
American-based human rights group, called on the administration to 
consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next 
year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation 
as a protest over the prison sentences. ``That would get Beijing's 
attention,'' Jendrzejczck said. Other China experts and scholars insisted 
that the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement 
with China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform 
would follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued. Peter Rodman, 
a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon 
Center in Washington, said that ``the United States cannot control 
the evolution of a society as complex as China's.'' He said the harsh 
prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, 
especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up 
a political party to challenge the Communists. ``The pattern of this 
regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody 
goes too far and there's a crisis,'' he said. ``I don't think you 
can blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give us 
credit for any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think 
there's much more we can do.''
