In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese 
courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 
years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political 
party. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial 
in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years. 
His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced 
to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days 
after his trial. Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition 
group of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community 
at large of a strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant during 
his tightly controlled trial on subversion charges. He refused to 
answer questions from prosecutors and judges and responded only to 
those from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, 
said. When the court asked if he would appeal, ``Xu Wenli said he 
would not appeal,'' Mo said, quoting his client as saying ``this is 
political persecution.'' Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict. 
``All he wanted to do was to advocate free speech and make sure the 
party registers peacefully. But the government failed this test, and 
now my father has to go to jail again for it,'' said daughter Xu Jin, 
a graduate student at Boston University. Security forces have orchestrated 
a concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards to 
crush the China Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people 
have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading 
member, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial. All three were charged 
with trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and 
Qin were given less than four days to prepare their defenses. Last 
Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police 
detained or scared off potential lawyers. No verdict has been announced 
in Qin's case. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang 
plotted subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party 
in both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua 
News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities. The courts 
ruled the two should be ``severely punished'' as repeat offenders, 
Xinhua said in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. 
Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and 
plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's 
Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters were kept 500 meters 
(yards) away from the building. Xu's wife was the only friend or family 
member given permission to watch the proceedings, along with an audience 
selected by court officials. She was escorted from her home to the 
courthouse by three plainclothes officers. Hours after the verdict, 
He Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. 
Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues and 
kept watch on the houses of others. ``Members of the China Democracy 
Party will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy,'' 
said Gao Hongmin, whose home was under surveillance. Gao, who helped 
Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said authorities would not 
be able to arrest all the party's supporters. In just six months, 
the party attracted enough of a following to try to register branches 
in 14 provinces and cities. The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, 
many of whom supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences 
and called for the dissidents' release. ``We are deeply disappointed 
with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given 
to Mr. Xu,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. ``No individual 
should be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising internationally 
recognized freedoms.'' Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the 
Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, 
mostly in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, 
he has been behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities. 
He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in setting 
up an independent human rights monitor and advised others to run for 
local legislative seats in Beijing. Xu became openly involved in the 
China Democracy Party in November. Wang Youcai, a student leader of 
the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, 
publicly declared the China Democracy Party's formation in June and 
said the group intended to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year 
ban on opposition politics. Police have sporadically detained supporters 
of the democracy party. The decisive move came on Nov. 30 as Chinese 
Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy 
two years of diplomatic forays. In a speech broadcast nationwide on 
Friday, Jiang warned against subversives trying to bring down the 
system and vowed never to copy Western democracy. To allay international 
criticism, China released a respected labor rights campaigner, Liu 
Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and sent him 
into exile in the United States.
