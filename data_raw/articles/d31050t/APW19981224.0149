His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition 
political party of its most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not 
afraid. A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies 
ready at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away. 
He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for 
a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu 
Wenli on Monday. ``Democracy is a process, and in that process a small 
number of people will be sacrificed,'' Zha, a 47-year-old former manager 
of a computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing 
branch, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. ``We want 
to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we believe that sacrifice 
is worthwhile.'' With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about 
the chances for success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party 
members will continue organizing and campaigning for change. His tenacity 
holds despite the summary trials and harsh punishments for Xu, Wang 
Youcai and Qin Yongmin _ prominent party principals from the provinces 
who were sentenced to 11 and 12 years _ and despite threatening signs 
from the ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned 
in a speech published Wednesday that political subversives threatened 
what he called China's fragile social order. ``Whenever any element 
that undermines stability raises its head, it must be resolutely nipped 
in the bud,'' Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. 
In its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to 
target ``the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist 
Party.'' ``We believe elections held after the establishment of a 
democratic system should decide who has the power,'' said Zha. What 
many the world over consider democracy is legally subversive in China 
for threatening the Communist Party-led system. In the past month, 
authorities have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained 
or interrogated at least 29 other party members. Police took Zha from 
his home Sunday afternoon and held him for nearly 24 hours to keep 
him from Xu's trial. Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party 
distinguished itself from past attempts at opposition by its openness. 
Organizers publicly announced their intention to set up the party. 
They tried to register with authorities. Statements were faxed to 
foreign media and human rights groups to circumvent China's state-controlled 
media. Now, the party's members _ about 500 by Zha's count _ are being 
driven underground. Party members will concentrate on increasing ranks 
and will be more guarded in the use of telephones and faxes and their 
occasional meetings, Zha said. ``If Xu and the other two were the 
first round, then the second round is very likely and it will be bigger,'' 
Zha said. ``In such an unbalanced contest, we are forced to use more 
secretive means.'' The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party 
of its more influential members, Zha said. All had proven track records, 
Xu and Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement 
20 years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy 
demonstrations in 1989. ``But from another aspect, this has strengthened 
the resolve of even more party members to struggle on,'' Zha said 
of the arrests. Zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, 
following Mao Tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. 
When he returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protests 
and continued his activism. Friends introduced him to Xu Wenli in 
1995. Having been released from prison two years before, Xu was still 
not openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his 
Beijing home to discuss China's future.
