By sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners 
to long prison terms, China on Monday took its harshest steps yet 
in its current crackdown on organized political opposition. After 
a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 
the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 
12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 
years for ``subversion of state power.'' Xu's alleged crimes included 
helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist 
rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent 
labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident 
abroad. He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court 
just four days ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, 
to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy 
Party, which has now been suppressed. Wang was tried on subversion 
charges on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, 
in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The punishment of a third veteran 
democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. His 
trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene 
on Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence is expected. 
Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's 
visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to 
move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the 
State Department. They also appeared to spell the effective end here 
of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds 
of lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months. The 
long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals 
here that China's warming relations with the United States in recent 
years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring 
a significant easing of political controls. Xu was tried Monday morning 
in the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge 
panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, ``I 
protest!'' said his wife of 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He 
and lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair 
and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were 
illegitimate. With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government 
has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one 
who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Xu first 
came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 
1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. 
In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out 
and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried 
to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants 
it has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil 
and political rights. In the face of several temporary detentions 
and stiff warnings, they continued their activities. Wang, in contrast, 
first became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate 
student in physics in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen 
Square demonstrations. After the student movement was smashed by the 
army, he was on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent 
two years in prison. During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang 
announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around 
the country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea. But while 
the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political 
topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has 
not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized 
groups _ to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on 
Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the president and 
Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the 
party, saying, ``The Western mode of political systems must never 
be adopted.'' After learning of Monday's sentences, the American Embassy 
here, which has spent the last two years building improved relations 
between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation 
of what it termed the ``deplorable decisions.'' ``We are deeply disappointed 
with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,'' 
the statement said. ``No individual should be arrested, tried and 
sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including 
those guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which China has committed itself.'' Like Thursday's trials, 
both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective 
lawyers had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding 
showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts 
could write their own rules. According to the criminal procedure law, 
defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but 
Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His 
wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his 
arrest on Nov. 30, was told three days ago. Under the law, defendants 
also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu was assigned 
a lawyer by the court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, 
the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, 
an associate of Mo's said. Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before 
the trial. ``Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the 
whole charade,'' she said in a telephone interview this weekend. Responding 
to the accusations during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued 
that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and 
that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, 
an associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that was clearly 
preordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend 
what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in 
the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was interested in politics 
even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960s, as an idealistic 
Marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend 
a university. He served in the navy for five years, then became an 
electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with 
the democracy movement and going to prison. On Monday afternoon, in 
a police station hours after the trial finished, Xu was allowed a 
half-hour with his wife. ``He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' 
she later recounted in a telephone interview. ``He said that this 
would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what 
has happened.'' Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said 
she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has 
a daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston 
University. In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested 
on Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way 
I am.'' If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should 
go on and enjoy her life. ``And if I die,'' Xu said as they parted 
that day, ``please plant a tree for me.''
