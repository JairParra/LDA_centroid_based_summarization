Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners, 
China sent a respected labor rights activist from jail into U.S. exile 
Sunday even as it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial. 
Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive 
a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate 
voice. He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy 
Party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members 
detained or questioned. For organizing the party and thereby challenging 
the ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused of subverting state 
power, a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison. To prevent 
supporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's 
Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch 
on the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based 
rights group reported. As police moved against Xu's friends, labor 
rights campaigner Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside 
Beijing and, with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada 
and then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years. 
Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before the 
end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled 
democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed for two years that 
Liu's health was worsening. But only last month did authorities grant 
a comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in 
the 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing 
of Liu's exile and Xu's trial was the most brazen in a string of high-profile 
dissident releases calculated to influence Western governments. Human 
rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release as cynical and manipulative. 
``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no 
true commitment to international human rights standards,'' said Xiao 
Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that 
Liu Qing heads. Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the 
West, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for 
bringing its spotty legal system closer to international standards. 
The ruling Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views 
among academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in 
the more open atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 
14 provinces and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and 
register the China Democracy Party. In a sign of the opposition party's 
appeal, 205 dissidents from across China issued a petition Sunday 
calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders, the 
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China reported. To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities 
have violated recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the 
rights of criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin 
Yongmin to trial with less than four days notice given to their families, 
instead of the 10 required by law. Qin and a third principal organizer, 
Wang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared 
off prospective lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses 
in separate trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced. The 
Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He Xintong, suspects 
it is merely a formality in what she expects to be a show trial. ``He 
hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to represent 
my husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the lawyer and his 
aide. Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to 
attend the trial, and He said she has been given one pass, for herself. 
Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement 
20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in solitary 
confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has played the role 
of elder adviser to dissidents. He became openly involved in the China 
Democracy Party in November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing 
and nearby Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party 
members and exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.
