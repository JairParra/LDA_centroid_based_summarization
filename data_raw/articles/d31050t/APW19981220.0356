China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from 
a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the 
United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by 
the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming 
trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is the third leading member 
of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion 
in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested 
or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China 
Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending 
the trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was 
free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing 
as manipulative. ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese 
government for this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, 
director of New York-based Human Rights in China. After 3 1/2 years 
in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts 
of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian 
Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother 
said. Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 
11-year-old daughter, the family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows 
the same pattern China used in freeing its two most famous dissidents, 
Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released 
Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison 
term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy 
campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for 
at least two years. In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide 
last month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach 
and bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, the United States and 
other Western governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese 
leaders have been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout 
the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among 
dissidents at home. In the only official comment on the release, the 
Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account 
Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole 
for medical treatment. ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at 
the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a 
type of human rights violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in 
a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. 
Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the fractured, 
persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons 
and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist 
Party rulers punish people they deem a threat. Liu was imprisoned 
three times in the past 17 years. His last arrest came after he signed 
a petition calling for labor rights in May 1995. Liu was never put 
on trial. Fourteen months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first 
learned of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor 
camp in the frigid, remote northeast. His term was the maximum police 
may impose on criminal suspects without trial. Labor camp officials 
later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge 
Chu claimed was fabricated. Inside the labor camp, Liu once started 
a hunger strike to protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle 
prods and confined to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where 
he could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beatings 
and detentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away 
and hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. 
human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September.
