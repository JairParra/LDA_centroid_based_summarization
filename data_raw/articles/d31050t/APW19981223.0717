The trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader 
Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown 
on dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech in 
six days, Jiang vowed to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule 
and preserve social stability. He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' 
_ a euphemism for following party orders. The speech, to senior law 
enforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently 
over the past 18 months as Chinese leaders sought to improve relations 
abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions 
for subversion this week of three political critics who tried to form 
an opposition party. To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national 
newspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- 
and 11-year prison terms given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. 
Dissidents are rarely mentioned by official media, and the reports 
served as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people. In the speech, 
reported by state television, Jiang said stability was crucial over 
the next year. He noted two key events on the political calendar: 
the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1 and China's 
recovery of the Portuguese colony of Macau on Dec. 20. ``We must strengthen 
the ideological and political education of officials and raise their 
awareness of and resistance to the sabotaging acts of hostile domestic 
and foreign forces,'' China Central Television quoted Jiang as saying. 
``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head, 
it must be resolutely nipped in the bud.'' Jiang did not exclusively 
target political enemies. He likened their threat to that of white-collar 
and ordinary criminals and ticked off a list of potentially volatile 
problems _ inefficient state industries, legions of laid-off workers, 
stagnating farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis on 
stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent 
of party pronouncements in the waning years of Jiang's mentor, Deng 
Xiaoping. After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from 
a major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform, 
not stability, were the bywords of the past year. Academic debates 
over the past year were the boldest in 10 years by China's relatively 
controlled standards. Party leaders too touted efforts to build a 
more comprehensive, predictable legal system and won praise from Western 
governments for signing U.N. rights treaties. ``Our active developments 
of foreign affairs has reached new achievements,'' Jiang said. ``Our 
country's stature has risen a step higher.'' By arresting and convicting 
Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trampled its own 
legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about 
its commitments to U.N. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 
months. Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents 
have continued to campaign for justice. Four elder members of the 
dissident community sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China 
to stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. 
``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock'' over 
the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detentions 
of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter dated Tuesday 
that was released by New York-based Human Rights in China on Wednesday. 
In addition, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of rotating 
24-hour fasts beginning Thursday to protest the sentences, the Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Wednesday 
night. The fasts were to have begun with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom 
authorities prevented from representing Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen 
in Liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two activists 
were detained by police Wednesday evening, the Hong Kong-based center 
said. The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others 
delivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the 
immediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London 
confirmed on Wednesday. It was conveyed on behalf of the European 
Union, the United States, Canada and Norway.
