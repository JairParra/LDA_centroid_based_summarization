German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently 
by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing 
of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international 
treaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese courts 
is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' 
immediate release. ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means 
to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed 
by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, 
Fischer said in a statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu 
Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an 
opposition political party.
