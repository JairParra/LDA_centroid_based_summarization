Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed 
Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. President 
Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with 
President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria. He called 
for a ``diplomatic dialogue'' to defuse the tension, said Assad's 
spokesman Jubran Kourieh. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country 
backs Syria in the dispute, which was triggered Sunday when Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would 
not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria 
denied the allegation. Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, 
prompting fears of an attack. The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated 
Sunday hat Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled 
Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah 
Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps. Lebanese Foreign 
Minister Faris Bweiz denied Monday that Kurdish rebels were based 
in his country. ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures 
had been taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop 
the activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz said at a news conference. 
Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa Valley 
and neighboring Syria. ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its 
call for resolving disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful 
dialogue,'' the Lebanese prime minister said in an interview with 
An-Nahar daily. Hariri said Turkey's military moves were the product 
of its newly forged military alliance with Israel. ``The Turkish threats 
are the first outcome of the Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' 
Hariri was quoted as saying. The Lebanese press also accused Israel 
of inflaming the tensions. ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence 
versus absolute Turkish folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of 
the leftist newspaper As-Safir. Israeli officials had no immediate 
comment because it is the Sukkot holiday and all government offices 
are closed. Since the Syrian-Turkish crisis began, Israeli defense 
minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said Israel is not a party to it and 
that the Israeli-Turkish military coooperation is not directed against 
any third state. Meanwhile, Syria's Assad received messages of support 
from Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz and from the leaders 
of Yemen and Sudan, said Syria's official news agency, SANA. The Arab 
leaders called for diplomatic solution to the crisis.
