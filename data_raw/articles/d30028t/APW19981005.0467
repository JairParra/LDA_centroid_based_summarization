Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed 
Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. President 
Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with 
President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria. Prime Minister 
Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute which was 
triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus 
that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering 
Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the allegation. Ankara has sent troops 
to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack. The Turkish 
daily Milliyet speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage pinpoint 
attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, 
where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, 
or PKK, maintain camps. Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said 
Monday there were no Kurdish rebels based in his country. ``The Turkish 
authorities fully know that measures had been taken in Syria and Lebanon 
more than a 1{ ago to stop the activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz 
told a news conference. ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in 
its call for resolving disputes with Turkey in the framework of a 
peaceful dialogue,'' He said. Ocalan in recent years was believed 
to shuttle between the Bekaa Valley and neighboring Syria. Hariri 
said in an interview with An-Nahar daily that Turkey's military moves 
were the product of its newly forged military alliance with Israel. 
``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the Turkish-Israeli 
strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying. The Lebanese press 
also accused Israel of inflaming the tensions. ``It is brilliant Israeli 
intelligence versus absolute Turkish folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, 
publisher of the leftist newspaper As-Safir.
