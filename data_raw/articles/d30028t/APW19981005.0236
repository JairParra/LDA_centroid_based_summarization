Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening 
dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and plans to dispatch envoys to the 
two countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday. Egypt already has 
launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation 
over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey later this 
week. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the offer of mediation 
in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa, 
on Sunday, said the paper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry. 
It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries. Tensions 
between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally, have escalated 
in recent days. Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting 
fears of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish 
jets violating Syria airspace near the border. Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday that Turkey would not allow its 
neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denies the allegation. 
Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish rebels, 
who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish 
population in southeastern Turkey. For its part, Syria has accused 
Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab 
security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks 
with the Jewish state. Turkey's military alliance with Israel has 
been condemned by Iran. Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening 
its supply of water by building dams on the Euphrates River.
