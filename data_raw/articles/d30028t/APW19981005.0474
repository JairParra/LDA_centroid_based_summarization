Greece on Monday warned that mounting tension between Turkey and Syria 
could lead to ``tragic results'' if not dealt with in its early stages. 
``Sources of tension are being created in our region,'' government 
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``We will have to deal with these 
sources from their birth, because they may develop out of control 
and we will be led to tragic results.'' Greece accused Turkey of undermining 
the whole region's stability through its stand-off with Syria over 
the alleged harboring of Kurdish rebels. ``Sadly, the tone of certain 
countries is not constructive,'' Reppas said. ``Turkey in particular 
... repeatedly dynamites every effort'' for the creation of a climate 
of regional stability. Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the 
frontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for 
cross-border raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases 
harboring Kurdish rebels. Syria has denied the charge. In the past, 
Turkish officials have also accused Greece of harboring Kurdish rebels 
and running guerrilla training camps. Athens denied the charge, and 
no evidence has been found to support the accusations. Relations between 
Greece and neighboring Turkey are rarely cordial. The two NATO allies 
are at odds over a variety of issues, and have twice reached the brink 
of war in the past 11 years over the Aegean Sea. But as neighbors, 
countries in the region must learn to get along, Reppas stressed. 
``No one can change geographical facts,'' he said. ``As we live in 
this region of the world ... we have to strive for good friendly relations 
and cooperation.''
