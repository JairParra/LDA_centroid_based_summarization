Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening 
dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and will dispatch envoys to the two 
countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday. Egypt already has launched 
a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation over 
Turkey's allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey later this 
week. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the mediation offer 
Sunday in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart, Farouk 
al-Sharaa, said the paper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry. 
It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries. Tensions 
between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally, have escalated 
in recent days. Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting 
fears of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish 
jets violating Syria airspace near the border. Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday that Turkey would not let its neighbor 
continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denies the allegation. Turkey 
long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish rebels, who 
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population 
in southeastern Turkey. For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of 
forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security 
and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the 
Jewish state. Turkey's military alliance with Israel has been condemned 
by Iran. Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of 
water by building dams on the Euphrates River. In Jordan, Crown Prince 
Hassan urged Demirel in a telephone call to ``exert all efforts to 
resolve the crisis without resorting to military confrontation,'' 
said Information Minister Nasser Judeh. Judeh said Hassan, who is 
acting as regent in King Hussein's absence, also told Demirel that 
Jordan was ``ready to provide any assistance'' to help resolve the 
dispute.
