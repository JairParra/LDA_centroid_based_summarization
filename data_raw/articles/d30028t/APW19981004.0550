As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday 
began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military 
confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria. Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey was in a position of self-defense 
and had suffered for many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking 
rebels. Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the 
Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it 
is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in 
Iraq, Iran and Syria. ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. 
``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot 
continue.'' He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel 
was warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military 
and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the military 
would be charged with solving the issue. ``Our patience has run out. 
We are determined to take all necessary measures if we don't see any 
response to our goodwill,'' the commander of Turkish land forces, 
Gen. Atilla Ates, said last week. Milliyet daily speculated Sunday 
that Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled 
Bekaa valley of Lebanon, where Turkey says the rebels have bases. 
Another report claimed the Turkish army had been put on alert. But 
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was the last 
resort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said. The war 
in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy for the country's 
large Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000 people since 1984. 
In an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over into 
the entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with 
his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus. Egypt's Middle East 
News Agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as saying 
that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the situation and 
that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not through confrontation 
or threats.'' Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this 
week would be fruitful. Jordan, which cautioned Syria and Turkey to 
take into consideration the higher interests of the region, offered 
to mediate. Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and 
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the 
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again 
accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria. ``We have 
no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
said Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.'' Israel has 
also instructed its army to limit military maneuvers along its border 
with Syria to avoid giving any impression that Israel is poised to 
act. On Sunday, the Arab League called on Turkey to end its military 
cooperation with Israel. Syria and Turkey have a long history of disagreements. 
Damascus is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates 
River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Syria 
of having aspirations over a Turkish border province, Hatay, which 
has a sizable Arab population.
