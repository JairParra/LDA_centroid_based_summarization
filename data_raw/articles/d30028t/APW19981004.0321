Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. 
Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said before their departure that 
Mubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power 
and threats.'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying 
that Arab support for Syria should not be read in Ankara as animosity 
toward Turkey. The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq 
al-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness 
of the situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and 
not through confrontation or threats.'' Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's 
trip to Turkey would achieve results. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said 
Mubarak was expected in Ankara, possibly on Monday. The talks in Damascus 
came as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after 
threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country. 
In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian frontier, 
a Turkish daily reported. Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to 
Riyadh on Saturday to get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for 
his mediation efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 
60 million people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes. 
``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military threats 
should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday. ``I am 
ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus and Ankara.'' 
Moussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad 
and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel 
through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis. Turkey long has 
accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting 
since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern 
Turkey. Syria denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. Late last week, 
Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to hit bases that Turkish 
Kurds use for their uprising. For its part, Syria has accused Turkey 
of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security 
and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the 
Jewish state. Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of 
dams on the Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water 
supply. Editorials in the Arab world called on both sides to show 
restraint. In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, published by Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the Turkish incursion into Iraq. 
``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the present 
tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. ``The Turkish buildup does 
not serve anybody as much as it will harm Turkey and Syria and other 
parties in the region.'' The English-language Egyptian Gazette said 
in an editorial on Sunday that ``the Syrians, understandably, harbor 
the belief that Turkey is being manipulated by its new-found ally, 
Israel, to pounce,'' with the dispute over Kurdish rebels being a 
pretext. Israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved 
in any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey. ``We have 
no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure 
Syria.''
